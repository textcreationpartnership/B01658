            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The matter of his Song is both divine and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, throughout it all he inſiſts upon theſe two, to diſcover what they were to themſelves, and what God was to them; he paralels their way with his way, that they finding the infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, might have other thoughts of themſelves and of him both.

Nay, I think it is poſſible they may both contribute to both theſe. Is there any more abaſing and humbling principle then Love?

Nay, though it be ſad to be ſo evil, void of all goodneſs, yet may the ſoul bleſſe him for evermore, that hath choſen this way to glorifie his Name, to build up his praiſe upon our ruine; May not a ſoul thus glory in ſad infirmities, becauſe his ſtrength is perfected i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The one is infinitely good and perfect; well, what ſhall we compare to him, <hi>who is like thee O God among the gods?</hi> Angels goodneſſe, their perfection and innocency, hath not ſuch a name and appearance in his ſight; ſo then, there can be no compariſon made this way, let no fleſh glory in his ſight in any thing, but, <hi>let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord,</hi> for in the ſight of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lord, all things do diſappear and evaniſh.

Is this an acceptable day to the Lord? the Lord upbraides the Jews, <hi>will thou call this a faſt?</hi> and what reaſon have we to aſk you, is it poſſible ye think ye do indeed faſt to the Lord? I cannot think that the moſt part of you dare ſay, that ever ye faſted or afflicted your ſouls.</p>
               <p>Always here is the way, if we conſider it, to ſpend a day acceptably to the Lord, enter in a ſerious conſideration of his Majeſty, and your ſelves; ſtudy on theſe two, till ye find your hearts bear the ſtamp of them, enlarge your hearts in the thoughts of them; both are infinite, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and power and mercy, and your ſin and miſery, no end of them; what ever ye find good in God, write up anſwerably to it, ſo much evil and ſin in your ſelves and the land: and what evil ye find in your ſelves and the land, write up ſo much goodneſſe and mercy in his account. All the names of his praiſe would be ſo many grounds of your confuſion in your ſelves, and would imprint ſo many notes of reproach and diſgrace upon the Creature, found ſo contrary to Him. This is even the exerciſe God calls us to this day, to conſider his wayes to us, and our wayes to him, how he hath walked, and how we have walked; becauſe ye loſe the ſight of theſe two, he ſends affliction, becauſe in our proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace we forget God, and ſo our ſelves; as ye find this people did, <hi>when ihey waxed fat they kicked againſt him, and forgat that he was their rock;</hi> we are ſo much taken up with our own eaſe and peace, that we do not obſerve him in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; therefore doth the Lord trouble our Peace,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:178706:6"/> removes theſe things we are taken up with, makes a publick proclamation of affliction, and bleſſed be his Name whoſe end is gracious, he means this, it is the proclamation of all his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, turn your eyes off your preſent eaſe here, conſider what I am, and what your ſelves are. No Nation ſo ſoon buries the memory of his Mercies, O how ſoon are they drowned in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, and we forget our own provocations, as ſuddenly, therefore muſt he write our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon a rod, that we may read them in great Letters, and he writes his former goodneſs in the change of his Diſpenſations, when his way to us changes, that we may know what is paſt. This is the great deſign that God hath in the World, to declare himſelf and his own Name, that it may be wondered and admired at by men, and this cannot be but by our ruine, a baſing us in the duſt; He therefore uſes to ſtain the pride of all glory, that his alone may appear without ſpot. This is then the great controverſie of God with men and nations in all generations, they will not ſee him alone exalted, and will not bow before him, and ſee their own vileneſſe. Why doth he overturn Kingdomes and Thrones? why doth he ſhake Nationes ſo often? here it is, Gods controverſie will never ceaſe, till all men acknowledge him in his highneſſe and holineſſe, as the ſole Fountain of all Life, and find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves vile, leſſe then nothing, nay worſe then nothing and emptineſſe. If ye would then have God at peace with the land and your ſelves; here is the compendious way, ſet him up a Throne of eminency in your hearts, and put your ſelves in the duſt, take with your own guiltineſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:178706:6"/> and naughtineſſe, and impoſſibility to help your ſelves, in your ſelves; hold theſe two ſtill in your eyes, that he may be alone exalted.</p>
               <p>Look how unequal a match, Ver. 4. 5. <hi>He is the Rock,</hi> a Rock indeed, if we ſpeak of ſtrength, lo, he is ſtrong; if of ſtability, he is <hi>the Lord and changes not, the ancient of dayes.</hi> Hath not thou heard and conſidered this, that <hi>the Almighty faints not, and wearies not.</hi> He holds forth himſelf in ſuch a name to his people, a ready, all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, perpetual and enduring refuge to all that truſt in him, and flie unto him as a Rock high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then they; and this is the foundation that the Church is builded on, <hi>againſt which the gates of hell ſhall not prevail.</hi> Gods Omnipotency for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, his eternity, faithfulneſſe and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe to make that ſure, his mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe makes a hole in that Rock to enter in, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy acceſſe for poor ſhipwrakt and broken men, who have no other refuge. This is our Rock on which the Church is builded, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, I Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. God were inacceſſible in himſelf, an impregnable Rock; how would ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners overcome him, and enter into him, to be ſaved from Wrath? Nay, but Jeſus Chriſt hath made a plain way and path, out of the waves of ſin and miſery, into this Rock higher then we; and ſo the poor ſoul that is loſt in its own eyes, and ſees no refuge, is forced to quite the broken ſhip of created confidence, for fear of periſhing; how doth it find a door in this Rock to enter? and there is water to drink of, <hi>a fountain of living waters</hi> comes out of it, and that <hi>is Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all theſe Names of his praiſe rub ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny marks of ſhame on his people; O how ſad is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:178706:7"/> the ſecret reproof and expoſtulation contained in this commendation of God, he hath been a Rock to us, our refuge that we fled unto, and found ſure; for as in our ſtraits, we mounted upon his power and were ſupported, when <hi>the floods lifted up their waves,</hi> yet have we left our Rock, gone out from our ſtrength; He offers himſelf a Rock unto us, his fulneſs and all ſufficiency for us, and yet <hi>we leave the fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and digs broken Ciſterns,</hi> had rather chooſe our own broken ſhip to toſs up and down into. He abides for ever the ſame; though we change, he changes not. How may it reprove our back-ſlidings, that we depart from our Rock, and where ſhall we find a refuge in the day of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Is there any created mountain but ſome floods of the time will cover; therefore it is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and madneſs to forſake this Rock that is ſtill above the floods, <hi>be is mightier then the noiſe of many waters.</hi> It may reprove our unbelief, we change our Faith according to his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our Faith ebbs and flows as the Tide of his Providence, and thus we are as ſticks fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the water, toſſed up and down; but would ye be eſtabliſhed as Mount Sion? would ye be unmoveable in the midſt of great waters, that they ſhall not come near unto you? then by all means get upon this Rock, that abides unmov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the midſt of the waves, though they ſhould beat on it, and the wind blow, yet it is proof of all tempeſt; all things might be driven up and down about you with the Lords diſpenſation, but ye ſhould abide the ſame, and might look round about you on the troubled ſea of mens minds, of lands and eſtates. If you come here,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:178706:7"/> ye may make ſhip-wrack, but ye ſhall not drown, though ye loſs the creatures comfort and defence, yet ye are on your Rock, which is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed before the rocks and mountains: you may be ſure of ſalvation, he that made the rocks and winds and ſeas, is your Rock.</p>

                  <hi>His VVork is perfect]</hi> As he doth not trouble himſelf when all is troubled about him; <hi>ſo he keeps him alſo in perfect peace whoſe mind is ſtayed on him,</hi> ſo alſo what he doth among men, though it cannot paſs without mans cenſure, yet it is in it ſelf perfect, compleat, without ſpot or defect. What is the ſubject of all mens queſtions, doubts, complaints, cenſures, expoſtulations and ſuch like, of which the World is full? Its ſome one Work of God or other; there is no Work of his Providence, but ſome man finds a fault in it, and would be at the mending of it. <hi>ne<expan>

                     </expan> Deus cum pluit, omnibus placet,</hi> if he give rain he diſpleaſes many, if he withhold it again, we are as little pleaſed. The reaſon of all this miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is, we look on his Work by parcels, and takes it not whole and intire, ſo it is perfect and cannot be made better. <hi>His VVorks are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> in relation to the beginning and original of them, his own everlaſting purpoſe; men often bring forth works by gueſſe, by their purpoſe, ſo no wonder it anſwer not their deſire; but <hi>known to him are all his works from the beginning,</hi> and ſo he doth nothing in time, but what was his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting pleaſure; often we purpoſe well, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve perfectly, but our practice is a criple, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it is maimed and imperfect; but all his Works are carved out, and done juſt as he deſigned them, without the leaſt alteration; and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:178706:8"/> if it had not been well, would he have thought on it ſo, and reſolved it before hand? <hi>His Works are perfect</hi> in relation to the end to which he appointed them. It may be it is not perfect in it ſelf, a blind eye is not ſo perfect as a ſeing eye, nay, but in relation to the glory of his Name, who hath a purpoſe to declare his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by reſtoring that ſight, it is as perfect. And in this ſenſe, all the imperfection of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Creation, all of them are perfect Works, for they accompliſh the end wherefore they were ſent; and ſo the night declares his Name and utters a ſpeech as well as the day, the winter as the ſummer, the wilderneſs as the fruitful field, for what is the perfection of the Creature, but in as far as it accompliſhes his purpoſe and end, as the maker of it ſerves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with it, and therefore all his Work is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for it is all framed in Wiſdome, to his own ends, in number, meaſure and weight; it is ſo exactly agreeing to that, that you could not imagine it better. Again, <hi>his Work is perfect,</hi> if we take it all together, and do not cut it in parcels, and look on it ſo. Is there any work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip beautiful, if ye look upon it in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while the Timber lies in one part, and the Stones in another? is that a perfect building when ye ſee one arm here, another there, &amp; a leg ſcattered beſide them? hath that image any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? certainly no; but look upon theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited, and then they are perfect; Letters and ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables make no ſenſe, till ye conjoyn them in words, and words in ſentences. Even ſo is it here, if ye look on the day alone; the light of it being perpetual would weary us, the night
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:178706:8"/> alone would be more ſo; but the interchange of them is pleaſant, day and night together make a diſtinct language of Gods praiſe; So God hath ſet proſperity and adverſity the one over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, one of them it may be, ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, nay, but it is a perfect Work that is made up of both; Spots in the face commend the beauty of the reſt of it.</p>
               <p>If ye would then look upon Gods Work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, look one it in the Sanctuaries Light, and ye ſhall ſay, <hi>He hath done all well.</hi> Joyn the end with the beginning, and behold, they agree very well; Many things among us ſeem out of order, many things uncompleat; The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of England, how great obſtruction was in the way of it? Is that now a perfect work? Yes certainly; for if we knew his end and purpoſe, it is very well, and could not be bettered by the Art of all men; <hi>His thoughts are far above our thoughts.</hi> The proſperous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted ſucceſſe of that party in England, is it a perfect work? yes certainly, for if ye could behold their end ye would ſay ſo, <hi>they are ſet in ſlippery places, their foot ſhall ſlide in due time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Entertain in this thought in your heart, that he hath done all well, let not your ſecret thoughts ſo much as call them in queſtion, if once ye queſtion, ye will quickly cenſure them; hold this perſwaſion, that nothing can be better then what he doth, nothing can be added and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diminiſhed from them, he doth all in number, weight and meaſure, its ſo exactly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to his purpoſe and deſigne, as if

               <p>Let this ſecretly reprove your hearts, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Works ſtains our works, O how imperfect are they? And which is worſe, how impudent and bold are we to cenſure his, and abſolve our own? If he have a hand in our work, yet theſe imperfect works, are perfect in regard of him, as we have a hand in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Works, yet his perfect Works are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in regard of us.</p>

If we abide within our ſelves, and men like our ſelves, we cannot wiſely judge our ſelves; our dim ſparkle will not make all the imperfections and ſpots appear; but if men would come forth in the preſence of his Majeſty, who <hi>turns darkneſs into light,</hi> and before whom hell is naked, O how baſe and vile
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:178706:9"/> would they appear in their own eyes? Is it any wonder that the multitude of you ſee not your ſelves, when holy <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> had this leſſon to learn? <hi>Eſay</hi> gets a diſcovery of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe in the ſight of Gods glorious holineſſe, <hi>Ch.</hi> 6. 5. which I think made all his former light darkneſſe; He cryes out <hi>unclean</hi> as if he had never known it before; And ſo <hi>Job, ſince I ſaw thee I abhored my ſelf in duſt and aſhes;</hi> Ye hear much of him, and it doeth not abaſe you, but if ye ſaw him, ye would not abide your ſelves; you would prefer the duſt you trade on to your ſelves. Ye who know moſt, there is a myſtery of iniquity in your hearts, that is not yet diſcerned, ye are but yet in the coaſt of that bottomleſſe Sea of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and vileneſſe. Among all the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of ſin, nothing doth ſo demonſtrate the folly, yea, the madneſſe of it, as the perfection, goodneſſe, and abſolute unſpottedneſſe of God. Its this that takes away all pretence of excuſe and leaves the famine nothing, no place to hide its confuſion and nakedneſſe and ſhame into. And therefore is it that <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this people of their ways and make them inexcuſable, he draws the paralel of Gods ways and their ways, declares what God is, how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly perfect in himſelf and in his works, had given no cauſe of provocation to them to depart from him; And then how odious muſt their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting be? When both are painted on a brod before their eyes; it makes ſin become exceeding ſinful, When the Lord would pierce the hearts of his people, and ingrave a challenge with the point of an Diamond he uſes this as his pen, <hi>Have I been a wilderneſs to Iſrael, a Land of darkneſs, why</hi>

                  <hi>ſay my people, we are Lords we will come no more to thee,</hi> Jer. 2. 31. <hi>What iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they are gone from me and walked after vanity,</hi> Jer. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>There are two things in ſin that exceedingly abuſe the creature, the iniquity of it, and folly and madneſs of it: Its contrare to all equity and reaſon to depart from him that hath made us, and given us a Law, to whom we are by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny obligations tyed. But what is the folly and madneſs of it? to <hi>depart from the fountain of living waters, and dig broken Ciſterns that can hold none.</hi> Ver. 13. This is a thing that the heavens may be aſtoniſhed at, and if the earth had ſenſe to underſtand ſuch a thing, the whole fabrick of it would tremble for horrour at ſuch a madneſſe and folly of reaſonable ſouls: And this evil hath two evils in it, we forſake life, and love death, go from him, and chooſe vanity. It's great ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to depart without an offence on his part; He may appeal all our conſciences and let them ſit down and examine his way moſt narrowly, <hi>what iniquity have ye found in me?</hi> what cauſe have ye to leave me? But when withall he is a living fountain, he is our glory, he is a fruitful land, a land of light, our ornament and attire, in a word, our life and our conſolation, our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and our beauty; what word ſhall be found, to expreſs the extream madneſs of men to depart from ſuch an one? &amp; change their glory into that which doth not profit? If either he were not a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of living waters, or if there were any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain beſide, that could yield water to ſatisfie the unſatiabledeſires of men, it were more excuſable, but what ſhadow ſhall be found, to cover ſuch
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:178706:10"/> an iniquity, that is both infinite ſin and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable loſs? Its the Scriptures ſtile given to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men, <hi>fools and ſimple,</hi> all ſin hath folly in it, but the people of Gods departing from him hath extremity of folly in it, beſide iniquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do embrace a dung-hill in inſtead of a Throne, they make the madeſt exchange that can be imagined, glory for ſhame, life for death, at leaſt conſolation and peace, for vanity and vexation and anguiſh of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>If ye would be duely affected with the ſight of your own evils, look upon them in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and in the view of God your large portion, ye will be forced to confeſs your ſelves <hi>beaſts in his ſight, Pſal.</hi> 73. 22. Oh that men would conſider how good and bleſſed the Lord is, how he is alone, and nothing beſide him in heaven and earth, all broken ciſterns, all dung and unprofitable, all vanity and vexation, he only ſelf-ſufficient, all others inſufficient, and therefore a proportioned good for our neceſſity &amp; deſires, and I am ſure ye would be conſtrained to cry out with <hi>David, Whom have I in heaven with thee, or in earth beſide thee? It is good for me to draw near to God.</hi> Ye would look on drawing near, and walking with him, and before him, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the moſt reaſonable thing, but the beſt thing, moſt beautiful for you, moſt profitable for you, and all other wayes would be looked on as the wayes of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His work is perfect]</hi> The Lord looked and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all was good that was made; ſo it was at firſt, the fabrick of this world was an exquiſite and perfect work, a ſuitable demonſtration of his infinite wiſdom, wonderful in all the parts
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:178706:11"/> of it, and in the unity and harmony of the whole: But ſo alſo his work of providence is perfect. Divine wiſdom hath framed and contrived all, and it cannot be better.

If ye do but conſider what a glorious high Throne he hath erected to himſelf for juſtice and judgement to be the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, and mercy and truth to go before it, upon the ruins of defaced man, what a Theater of Juſtice he hath erected upon the Angels falls, ye would call it as perfect a work as is in the world.

Now what do ye ſee of it, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, though ye comprehend all your time in one thought, yet certainly ye cannot judge it aright, for it is but one work that all the ſeveral buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and caſtings down, all the ſeveral diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of his providence from the beginning to the end make up; and when we think upon theſe disjoyned, limit our conſideration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of our own time; can we rightly apprehend it? Nay, which is worſe, we uſe to have no more within the compaſſe of our thought, but ſome preſent thing, and how much more do we err then?

Yes certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if ye compound them with your Sun-ſhines, and calms; ſeveral colours make Pictures beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful: the one is as needful as the other. And if ye did conſider your profit more then your honour and pleaſure, ye would ſay ſo. He doth not model his works according to our fancy to pleaſe us, but our good to profit us, and he is wiſer then we, and ſo then it is the moſt perfect work in it ſelf, that poſſibly diſpleaſeth us moſt. Therefore ye would judge of his dealing by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rule, nor your ſatisfaction; for pleaſe you and periſh you. If he ſpared the rod, he ſhould hate us indeed; fond love is real hatred.

Though God often change his work, do not think he changes his Counſel and Purpoſes as men do. No, <hi>he is in one mind and who can turn him,</hi> therefore he had that change in his mind when he made the work, when he erected ſuch a throne, he had this in his mind to caſt it down within ſuch a ſpace, and ſo his change, his throwing down, is as perfect in his mind as his building up. Ye have large and big apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of temporal Kingdoms and Crowns of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and ſuch like as if they were great yea only things: but they are not ſo to him: all this world and its ſtanding, all the Kingdoms and their affairs are not his great work and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; he hath an great work, <hi>the bringing of many ſons to Glory,</hi> and compleating of Jeſus Chriſt, building of that glorious myſtical buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the holy Temple made up of living ſtones, of which Chriſt is the foundation and chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone both; and its this that he attends to moſt; other works among men though they have more noiſe, they are leſſe concerned; all theſe are but in the by, and ſubſervient to his great deſigne, and like the Scaffolds of a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that are, it may be, ſometime very needful, Nay, but when the building is compleated, he ſhall remove all theſe, he hath no more uſe of them; <hi>Kings ſhall he thy nurſe-fathers, Kings ſhall bow to thee.</hi> He is not much concerned in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

Behold, the Lord will aſſert his own wayes, and plead with all fleſh this controverſie, that all his proceedings are full of equity, he walks according to a rule though he be not tyed to a rule, he walks accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of Wiſdom, Juſtice and Mercy, though his illimited ſoveraignty might be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground of clearing of all his proceedings. But we walk not according to a rule, though we be bound to a rule and a rule full of equity.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:178706:14"/>
               <p> Here is the equity and juſtneſſe of his ways, the Goſpel holds it forth in a twofold conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Firſt, If any man turn from his iniquity, and flie unto my Son as the City of refuge, <hi>he ſhall live, he hath eternal life,</hi> iniquity ſhall not be his ruine, although he hath done iniquity; <hi>O who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity?</hi> Is not this compleat mercy? whatever iniquity hath been, aggravat it as ye can, though it could have ruined a world, yet it could not have rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee, that turns in to Jeſus Chriſt from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. What exception can all the world have againſt this, or his walking according to it. And on the other hand whoſoever continueth in ſin, though he appear to himſelf and others never ſo righteous, if he entertain and love any known ſin, and will not part with it for Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ſhall not he dye in his iniquity?</hi> Is there any iniquity in this, that he receive the wages of his works his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? that he eat of the fruit of his own wayes? and drink of his own devices? But how many hearts cenſure this way as a rigid and ſtrick ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere dealing: the multitude think it cruelty to condemne any Chriſtened ſoul, to put ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in hell; the civil man will think it's too hard meaſure that he ſhould be ranked in hell with the prophane. But certainly, <hi>all mouths ſhall be ſtopped one day, and he ſhall be juſtified when he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es;</hi> Ye that will not juſtifie him in his ſayings and ſet to your ſeal to the truth of the word, you ſhall be conſtrained to juſtify him, when he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuts that ſentence, ye ſhall precipitat your own ſentence and rather wonder at his clemency in ſuffering you ſo long.</p>
               <p>This way of the Lord is equal and right in it ſelf, but it is not ſo to every one, <hi>the juſt man ſhall</hi>

Yet for as equal and ſtraight as it is, many other tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors ſhall fall therein; they ſtumble even in the noon day, and high way where no offence is, It's true often his own people ſtumble in it as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 73. and 94. <hi>Davids foot was ſlipping,</hi> yet a ſecret hold was by mercy. It often requires a wiſe and prudent man to underſtand it, becauſe <hi>his footſteps are in the deep waters.</hi> Pſa. 77. 19. <hi>his way is in the depths of the ſea, his paths in great waters,</hi> ſo that men muſt wait till the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound his own wayes, till he come out of the waters and make them a dry plain, and this is our advantage, the word ſayes <hi>he is near thee in thy mouth, and neither above nor beneath in the depths that thou needs neither deſcend nor aſcend to know it,</hi> Deut. 30. 11, 12, 13, 14. But his way is in the depths, and his footſteps are not known, ſo that we ought to hold us by the word till he expound his vvork, his vvord vvill teach us our duty and vve may commit unto him his ovvn vvay, the vvord is a commentary to expound his vvays. <hi>David</hi> loſt the ſight of Gods footſteps and vvas like to wander, till he came to the Sanctuary, and this ſhined as a Candle in a dark place, he learned there to know the unknown footſteps and to follow them. By all means embrace the Word and be ſatisfied with it, when ye do not comprehend his Work, it teaches as much in general, as may put us to quietneſſe, all his wayes are Judgement, Juſt and True in all his Wayes is the King of Saints. If I do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend how it is, no wonder, for he makes darkneſſe his covering, he ſpreads over his moſt curious Engines and Pieces of Workmanſhip,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:178706:15"/> a vail of darkneſſe for a ſeaſon, and <hi>who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him when he hides himſelf</hi> ſayes <hi>Job,</hi> and though he withdraw the Covering, yet what am I; <hi>Who can by ſearching find out God?</hi> If I ſhall examine his way, what rule ſhall I take to try it by? If I meaſure by my ſhallow capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or by my crooked way, ſhall I have any juſt account of it? will my Arm meaſure the Heavens as his doth? If I examine it, or try it by himſelf, He <hi>is high as Heaven and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable.</hi> Therefore it becomes us to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to his Word, and believe its ſentence of his Work, when reaſon cannot comprehend it.</p>
               <p>One thing (if it were deeply engraven on our hearts) would be a principle of ſetling our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, in all the myſteries and riddles of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the knowledge and faith of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, of his Highneſſe and of his Wiſdome; ſhould he give account of his Matters to us?

               <p>
                  <hi>A God of Truth]</hi> Strange it is that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty is pleaſed to cloath himſelf with ſo many Titles and Names for us. He conſiders what our neceſſity is, and accordingly expreſſes his own Name. I think nothing doth more hold forth the unbelief of men and Atheiſm of our hearts, nor the many ſeveral Titles God takes in Scripture; There is a neceſſity of a multitude of them to make us take up God, becauſe we ſtaying upon a general notion of God, rather frame in our imaginations an Idol then the true God. As there is nothing doth more lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the unbelief of our hearts, then the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Promiſes: Men that conſider ſuch frequent repetitions of one thing in Scripture, ſo many diverſe expreſſions of one God, may retire into their own hearts, and find the cauſe of it, even the neceſſity of it; But while we look ſo ſlightly on theſe, we muſt judge it ſuperfluous and vain. Needed there any more to be ſaid, but <hi>I am your God, I am God,</hi> if our ſpirits were not ſo far degenerated unto Atheiſm and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Certainly that word <hi>Jehovah</hi> holds forth more to Angels then all the inculcated Names
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:178706:17"/> and Titles of God to us; becauſe we are dull and ſlow of heart. Therefore wonder at theſe two when ye read the Scriptures; Gods Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendency to us, and our Atheiſm and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of him; they are both myſteries and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding broad. There is not a Name of God but it gives us a Name, and that of reproach and diſhonour; ſo that for every one, ſome evil may be written down; and it is to this purpoſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> draws them out in length, that in the Glaſſe of his glorious Name, the people might behold their own ugly face. This Name is clear, <hi>He is a God of Truth,</hi> not only a true God, but Truth it ſelf; to note his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Eminency in it. It is Chriſts Name, <hi>I am the Truth,</hi> the ſubſtantial Truth, <hi>in whom all the Promiſes are Truth, are Yea and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> His Truth is his Faithfulneſſe in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Promiſes, and doing what his Mouth hath ſpoken: And this <hi>is eſtabliſhed in the very Heavens,</hi> Pſal. 89. 2. His everlaſting purpoſe is in Heaven where he dwells; And if any man can aſcend up to Heaven, if any creature can break through the Clouds, then may his Truth be ſhaken. His Word comes down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; Nay, but the foundation of it is in Heaven, and there is his Purpoſe eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore, there is nothing done in time can impare or hinder it. Ye think this World very ſure, the Earth hangs unmoveable, though it hang upon nothing; All the tumults, confuſions and reels hath been in the World, have never moved it to the one ſide. Heaven goeth about in one Tenure perpetually, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the ſame diſtance. Nay, but his Truth
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:178706:17"/> is more eſtabliſhed then ſo. Heaven and Earth depends but upon a word of Command, he hath ſaid, <hi>let it be ſo,</hi> and <hi>ſo it is.</hi> Nay, but his Word is more eſtabliſhed. of it ſaith Chriſt <hi>One jot or title of it cannot fail, though Heaven and earth ſhould fail.</hi> He may change his Commands as he pleaſes, but he may not change his Promiſe, this puts an obligation on him, as he is Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true to perform it; and when an Oath is ſuperadded, O! how immutable are theſe two? When he promiſes in his Truth and ſwears in his Holineſſe. Is there any power in Heaven and Earth can break that double cord? <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6, 18. There is no name of God but it is comfortable to ſome, and as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to others. What comfort is it to a godly man that truſts in his Word, <hi>He is a God of truth?</hi> An honeſt mans word is much, his oath is more. What ſhall his Word be who is a God of Truth? Who, though all men ſhould be liars, yet God is true. Ye who have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured your Souls on his Word, ye have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable advantage, <hi>his truth endures for ever, and it is eſtabliſhed in the Heavens,</hi> the ground of it is without beginning, the end of it without end. Ye are more ſure then the frame of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, <hi>for all theſe ſhall wax old as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> We ſpeak of a naked word of truth; Indeed it is no naked word that is Gods Word; His Works of Providence, and his Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to yow, is a naked and bare foundation, nay, a ſandy foundation, and ye who lean ſo much to them, is it any wonder, ye ſo often ſhak and waver? All other grounds beſide the Word, are uncertain, unſtable, this only endures for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:178706:18"/> ever; The creatures goodneſſe and perfection is but as the Graſſe and the Flour of the Field; Venture not much on your diſpoſitions and frames, thou knows not what a day may bring forth, but his Truth is to all generations, and it is well tryed, as Gold ſeven times; all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations have tryed it and found it better then pure Gold. His Diſpenſations are arbitrary, no rule to you; he loveth to declare his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty here, and to expatiat in the creatures ſight, beyond its conceiving; but he hath limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in his Word, and come down to us, and laid bonds on himſelf. Will he then unty them for us? Give him liberty where he loves it; take him bound where he binds himſelf. How may God expoſtulate with this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as theſe of little faith? <hi>How long ſhall I be with you</hi> ſaith Chriſt? How long will Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians tempt the Lord in ſeeking ſigns? And will not reſt upon his only Word and Promiſes? O Adulterous generation, how long ſhall <hi>I</hi> be with you and ye will not believe?

The Serpent brought them to this queſtion, <hi>Hath God ſaid ye ſhall die?</hi> And then preſently the queſtion intertained becometh a concluſion, <hi>ye ſhall not ſurely die.</hi> Thus ye ſee how the lyar, from the beginning, was contrair to the God of Truth: And he murdered us by lying of that God of Truth: And it is the ſame that ſhuts out all hope of remedy. Ye do not as yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and conſider that curſe that was pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but is now alſo inflicted upon us; Therefore there is no ſolid belief can be of the promiſes of the Goſpel: And ye who think ye believe the Goſpel, do but indeed fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it, except ye have conſidered the true curſe of God on all fleſh. But if any man have ſet to his ſeal that God is true in his Threatning, and ſubſcribed unto the Law; Then I beſeech you add not the unbelief of the Goſpel unto your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſobedience. <hi>He is a God of truth,</hi> in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings. It is ſtrange how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward and froward we are, a perverſe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we do not believe his Threatnings, but fancie we receive his Promiſes, or elſe believe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Threatnings, we queſtion his Promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. But know this for a truth, his laſt Word is more weighty, and the unbelief of it is moſt dangerous. Ye have not keeped his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and ſo the curſe is come upon you, do ye believe that? If ye do, then the Goſpel ſpeakes unto you, The God of Truth hath one word more, <hi>He that believes ſhall be ſaved,</hi> notwithſtanding of all his breaking of the Law; if ye do not ſet your Seal to this alſo, then ye

                  <hi>Without iniquity:</hi> who doubts of that, ſay ye? What needs this be added, who charges him with iniquity or ſin? Nay, but ſtay and conſider, and you ſhall find great weight in this. It is true none dare charge him openly, or ſpeak in expreſſe terms againſt his Holineſſe, yet if we judge of our own and others practices and diſpoſitions, as the Lord uſeth to conſtruct of them; if we reſolve our murmurings, impatience, ſelf-abſolutions and excuſes to hold off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, into plain language, if we would tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate them into a Scripture-ſtyle, certainly it will be found, that the moſt part of men, if not all, uſe to impute iniquity to God, and accuſe him rather, then take with accuſations laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves. And therefore the Lord uſeth to go to Law with his people, he who is the Judge of the world, that cannot do unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>he who is the potter, and we all the clay,</hi> yet he ſo far condeſcends to us for convincing us, as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:178706:20"/> ſometimes to refer the controverſie between him and his people, to other creatures, as <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 12. He calls the mountains and the foundations of the earth to judge between him and his people, and ſometimes he appeals unto their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and is content though judge, to ſtand and be judged by theſe who were guilty, as verſ. 3, and <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. verſ. 5, and 31. All this ſuppoſes that when the Lord would endeavour to convince them of iniquity, they did rather recriminat and took not with their own faults. This is a truth generally acknowledged by all. <hi>He who is the judge of the world doth no iniquity,</hi> But O! that ye conſidered it, till the meditation of it were engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on your Spirits, the ſeal of Gods holineſſe, that ye might fear before him, and never call him to accompt for his matters. Who can ſay I have purged my heart from iniquity? Among men the holieſt are defiled with it, and ſo are all their actions. But here is one that ye may give him an implicit faith (ſo to ſpeak) <hi>he is a God of truth,</hi> and can ſpeak no lie, <hi>be does no iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and cannot do wrong to any man. Would there be ſo much impatience amongſt you, and fretting againſt his diſpenſations, if ye believed this ſolidly? Would ye repine againſt his holy and juſt wayes, were it not to charge God with iniquity? Your murmuring and grudging at his diſpenſations is with child of blaſphemies, and he who can ſearch the reins ſees it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſtructs ſo of it: You ſay by interpretation, that if ye had the government of your own matters, or of Kingdoms, ye would order them better then he doth; how difficult a thing is it to perſwade men to take with their own iniquity? O how many
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:178706:20"/> excuſes and pretences, how many extenuations are uſed that this conviction may not pierce deeply? But all this ſpeaks ſo much blaſphemy, that iniquity is in God. Ye cannot take with your own iniquities, but ye charge his Majeſty with iniquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſt and right is he:]</hi> Is this any new thing, was it not ſaid already, that he is <hi>without iniquity,</hi> and <hi>his wayes judgement?</hi> But alas, how igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant are we of God, and ſlow of heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as he is, therefore is there <hi>line upon line, and precept upon precept,</hi> and name upon name, if it be poſſible that at length we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God as he is: Alas, our knowledge is but ignorance, our light darkneſſe, while it is ſhut up in the corner of our mind, and ſhines not into the heart, and hath no influence on our practice. And the truth is, the belief of divine truths is almoſt no more but a not contradicting them, we do not ſeriouſly think of them as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſent to them, or deny them. Is there any conſideration amongſt us now of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and righteouſneſſe, though it be frequently ſpoken of? And what advantage ſhall ye have if ye do not conſider them? O how hard is it to perſwade mens hearts of this, that God is juſt, and will by no means acquit the guilty, there are ſo many deluſions drunk in in mens hearts, contrary to his truth; <hi>Let no man deceive you, be not deceived with vain words, know ye not,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, theſe are ſtrange pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, would ye not think the point of truth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, that there needed ſo much prefacing unto, and yet what is it? even that which all men grant, Gods wrath comes on the children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:178706:21"/> but alas, few men conſider but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves with dreams of eſcaping it, though men know it, yet they know it not, for they walk as if they knew no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Alwayes however this is of little moment to affect our ſpirits now, yet in the day that God ſhall ſet your iniquities before your face, and ſet his juſtice alſo before your eyes, O how ſad and ſerious a thing will it be then? If theſe two verſes were ingraven on our hearts, Gods juſtice and holineſſe, our corruption and vileneſſe, I think there would be other thoughts among us then there are.</p>

                  <hi>Their ſpot is not]</hi> Why doth the Lord take pleaſure to reckon their ſins, to deſcribe ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable a People. Is not this <hi>Jacob in whom he ſaw no iniquity?</hi> Is not this <hi>Iſrael, whoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions are not known?</hi> Certainly if this people would have charged themſelves ſo, he would not have done it. He loves to forget, when we remember our ſins; But he muſt remember them, when we forget them. What is the Lords great controverſie with men, here it is, how can ye ſay or think that ye are not polluted? Or if ye take with ſuch a General; Yet, why is not the conviction of your ſin and miſery ſo deeply engraven, as to purſue you out of all hope of remedy in your ſelves, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 22, 23. <hi>And therefore is thine iniquity marked before me,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:178706:24"/> ſaith the Lord. God hath determined not to wrong his Juſtice. If men ſhould go away unpuniſhed and unjudged both, where were his Righteouſnes? If there were no record of mens tranſgreſſions, were he a righteous Judge? Therefore, thoſe who do not judge themſelves, muſt leave judgement to him; For once the mouth of <hi>all fleſh muſt be ſtoped, and all become guilty before God.</hi> Why pleads the Lord with man? Becauſe man ſayes <hi>I am innocent, I have not ſinned, his anger will turn away,</hi> Jer. 2. 35. Will any ſpeak ſo in termes? No in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but the Lord conſtructs ſo of the moſt part; becauſe they do more conſider the wrongs done to them, nor their own wrongs done to God: All men confeſſe the general; that they are ſinners; but who ſearches and tryes his way to find out particulares, and in as far as ye do not charge your ſelves with particular guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, until ye be afraid of his anger, as long as the conſideration of your ſins is ſo ſuperficial and ſhallow, that ye apprehend no danger of wrath, or immunity from it, certainly God will plead with you. Juſtice muſt ſo far be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, as once to conclude you under the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death; If ye do it not now, then ye leave God to be your Judge and Party. But if any man ſhall take with his guiltineſſe, till his mouth be ſtopped, and condemne himſelf in Gods ſight; <hi>I</hi> ſay Mercy and Grace in God muſt not be wronged, <hi>he that judges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhall not be judged of the Lord.</hi> VVhat a fair offer is this to you all?

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:178706:30"/> the moſt attractive drawing manner that can be imagined. And then when the deſires are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, yet if there be no Oyl of hope to feed it, it will ſoon cool again. Therefore take a view again, and you may have boldneſſe to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Holieſt, by the Blood of Jeſus. There was ſome kind of diſtance kept in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, none but the High Prieſt might enter into the Holieſt Place; But the entry of our High Prieſt into it, that is into Heaven, hath made it patent to all that come to him and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his Blood. There is a new and living way by the holy fleſh of Chriſt, conſecrated and made of infinite value and uſe, by the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Perſon: And therefore, having ſuch a one of our kindred ſo great with God, <hi>we may draw near with a true heart, and full aſsurance of faith, having our conſciences ſprinkled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 18. 19, 20. &amp;c. Now, ſince the way is made plain to you, and the entry is opened up in the Goſpel; Do you not find your hearts ſtir with in you to draw near to him? Do you not find a neceſſity of making peace by ſuch a Mediator? O! that you knew the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between God and your Natures, and what the hazard is: <hi>Loe, they that are far from thee ſhall periſh:</hi> Then certainly, you would take hold of this invitation, and be eaſily drawn unto Jeſus Chriſt. But unto you who have adventured to draw near for pardon of ſin in Chriſt; I would recommend unto you, that you would draw yet nearer to God. After that the partition wall of wrath and condemnation is removed; yet there is much darkneſſe in your minds, and corruption in our natures that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:178706:31"/> from him. I mean intercepts and diſturbs that bleſſed communion you are called unto. Therefore I would exhort you, as James, <hi>draw near to God, and he will draw near to you,</hi> ch. 4. 8. And that, wherein this moſt conſiſts, is in ſtudying that purification of our natures, that cleanſing of our hearts from guile, and our hands from offences, by which our Souls may draw towards a reſemblance of God. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and drawing near to God in aſſimilation, and conformity of nature, is the great deſigne of the Goſpel, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> Now ye are agreed, <hi>walk with him,</hi> Amos 3. 3. <hi>As Enoch walked with God,</hi> Gen. 5. 24. That is, labour in all your converſation, to ſet him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, and to ſtudy to be well pleaſed with him in all things, and to pleaſe him in all; to conform your ſelves to his pleaſure in every thing. And this Communion in walking, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſiſts, in that Communication of the Spirit with God in prayer: This is the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſweateſt approach, when the Soul is lifted up to God, and is almoſt out of it ſelf in him: And this being the ordinary exerciſe and motion of the Soul, it exceedingly advances in the firſt point of nearneſſe, that is, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with God. Drawing often near in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in prayer, makes the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw towards his likeneſſe, even as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of men together, will make them like one another.</p>
               <p>Now for the commendation of this, <hi>It is good;</hi> What greater evil can be imagined then ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the greateſt Good? And what great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good, then acceſſion to the greateſt Good
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:178706:31"/> Every thing is in ſo far happy and well, as it is joyned with and enjoyeth that which is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for it. Light is the perfection of the Earth, remove it, and what a diſconſolat and unpleaſant thing is it? Now truely there is nothing ſuitable to the immortal Spirit of man, but God; And therefore, all its happineſſe or miſery muſt be meaſured by the acceſſe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, Nearneſſe or diſtance of that infinite Goodneſſe. Therefore, is it any wonder, <hi>that all they that go a whoring from him, periſh,</hi> as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans heart doeth: For we are infinitly bound by Creation, by many other bonds ſtronger then wedlock, to conſecrat and devote our ſelves wholly to God, but this is treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly broken: Every man turns aſide to vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and lies, and is guilty of heart whoredome from God and ſpiritual idolatry, becauſe the Affection that ſhould be preſerved chaſt for him, is proſtitute to every baſe object: So then, this divorcement of the Soul from God, cannot but follow thereupon, even an eternal ecclipſe of true and real life and comfort. And whoever draw back from the Fountain of Life and Salvation, cannot but find elſewhere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and deſtruction. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, let us ſet this aſide all other things which are the purſuites and endeavours of the moſt part of men. Mens natural deſires are carried towards Health, Food, Raiment, Life and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Peace and ſuch like. But the more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſort of men, ſeek after ſome ſhadow of Wiſdom and Virtue. Yet the generality of men, both high and low, have extravagant, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited deſires toward Riches, Pleaſure, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:178706:32"/> And all that we have ſpoken, is incloſed within the narrow compaſſe of mens abode here, which is but for a moment; ſo that if it were poſſible, that all theſe foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſires and delights of men, could attend any man for the ſpace of an hundreth years, though he had the concurrance of the ſtreames of the Creatures to bring him in ſatisfaction, though all the world ſhould bow to him and be ſubject to the beck of his authority, without ſtroak of Sword, though all the Creatures ſhould ſpend their ſtrength and wit upon his ſatisfaction; yet do but conſider what that ſhall be within ſome few years, when he ſhall be ſpoiled of all that attendance, denuded of all external comforts, when the fatal period muſt cloſe his life, peace, health and all; and his poor Soul alſo, that was drowned in that guif of pleaſure, ſhall then find it ſelf robbed of its precious Treaſure, that is, Gods favour, and ſo remain in everlaſting baniſhment from his preſence. Do ye think, I ſay, that man were happy. Nay! O happy <hi>Lazarus</hi> who is now bleſſed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, who enjoyes an eternity of happineſſe, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments miſery. But my beloved, you know that it is not poſſible, even to attain to that imagined happineſſe here. All the gain that is found, is not able to quit the coſt and expenſe of grief, vexation, care, toyling and ſweating that is about them.</p>
               <p>But if you would be perſwaded, there is that to be found eaſily, which you trouble your ſelves ſeeking elſewhere: And believe me, though the general apprehenſion of men be, that peace, plenty, preferment and ſatisfaction in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:178706:32"/> this life, to compenſe their pains, is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily attainable then fellowſhip and communion with God; Yet I am perſwaded that there is nothing more practicable then the life of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. God hath condemned the World under vanity and a curſe, and that which is crooked, can by no art or ſtrength be made ſtraight; But he hath made this attainable, by his gracious Promiſes, even a bleſſed life, in approaching near to himſelf the Fountain of all Life. And this is a certain Good, an univerſal Good, and an eternal Good. It will not diſapoint you as other things do, of which, you have no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for all your toylings. This is made more infallible to a ſoul that truely ſeeks it in God. It is als certain, that they cannot be aſhamed through fruſtration, as that he is faithful. And then it is an univerſal Good, one comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of all, one eminently and virtually all things created, to be joyned to the infinite all-fulneſſe of God: This advanceth the Soul to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of all that is in him. This is health, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. laſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 8. This is light, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8. 12. It is life, <hi>Jo.</hi> 11. 25. Liberty, <hi>Job.</hi> 8. 36. Food and Raiment, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61. 10. And <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 14. And what not? It is profit, pleaſure, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſuperlative degree, and not ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſo many various ſtreames, which divide and diſtract the heart, but all conbined in one. It is the true Good of both Soul and Body, and ſo the only Good of man. And laſtly it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to be coaetaneous with thy Soul: Of all other things it may be ſaid, <hi>I have ſeen an end of them,</hi> they were and are not: but this will ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive time, and all the changes of it, and then it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:178706:33"/> will begin to be perfect, when all perfection is at an end. Now from all this, I would exhort you in Jeſus Chriſt, to ponder thoſe things in your hearts, and conſider them in reference to your own Souls, that ye may ſay with David, <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which all men ſeek after, is happineſſe and well being. Men purſue nothing but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of Good; And to compleat that which may be called Good, there is requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome excellency in the thing it ſelf, and then a conveniency and ſutableneſſe to us; And theſe joyntly draw the heart of man. But the great miſery is, that there is ſo much ignorance and miſapprehenſion of that which is truely Good; And then when any thing of it is known, there is ſo little ſerious conſideration and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to our ſelves; And this makes the moſt part of men wander up and down in the purſuit of divers things, which are not that true Good of the Soul, and ſet their hearts on that which is not, until they find their hearts fall down, as wanting a foundation, and then they turn about again to ſome other vanity. And ſo the wanderings and ſtrayings of men are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, becauſe the by-wayes are innumerable, though the true way be but one: Yea, the turnings, and toylings of one man are various and manifold, becauſe, he quickly loſſes the ſent of happineſſe in every way he falls into, and therefore muſt turn to another. And thus men are never at any ſolid ſetting about this great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; never reſolute wherein this happineſſe conſiſts, nor perremptor to follow it; But
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:178706:33"/> they fluctuat upon uncertain apprehenſions, and divers affections, until the time and date of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation expire, and then they muſt know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and ſurely, the inevitable danger and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable loſſe they have brought themſelves to, who would not take notice of the ſure way, of eſcaping both wrath, and attaining happineſſe while it was to be found.</p>
               <p>Well then, this is the great buſineſſe we have here to do; yea, to make the circle the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it is that great buſineſſe we have to do in this world, to know wherein the true well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal wellfare of our Souls conſiſts, and by any means to apply unto that, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing neceſſary, in regard of which, all other things are Ceremonies, Circumſtances and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things. And to guide us in this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Application, here is one man who having almoſt made ſhipwrack upon the Rocks which men commonly daſh upon, and being by the Lord led ſafely by, and almoſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Coaſt of true Felicity, he ſets out a Beacon, and lights a Candle to all who ſhall follow him, to direct them which way they ſhall ſtirre their courſe. Examples teach more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually then Rules; It is eaſie for every man to ſpeak well upon this Point in general, and readily all will acknowledge, that here it is, and no where elſe: But yet all this is outcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the contrary noiſe of every mans practice. Theſe general grants of Truth, are recalled in the converſations of men; Therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have much influence upon any man: But when we hear one ſpeak, and ſee him walk ſo too; when we have the example of a moſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:178706:34"/> wiſe man, who wanted not theſe worldly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, which other men have; So that he not only propones it to us, but after much ſerious adviſement, after mature conſideration of all that can be ſaid, of the wickeds beſt eſtate and the godlies worſt, ſetting down reſolute concluſions for himſelf. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God;</hi> Yea, ſo determinate into it, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The words you ſee, are the holy reſolution of a holy heart, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that which is the chiefeſt Good.

But yet, Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſpeak more inwardly, and as your Souls ſtand in the ſight of God. The generality of thoſe who are near hand in outward Ordinanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:178706:35"/> are yet far off from God in reality, <hi>without God and without Chriſt,</hi> as really as touching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Soul feeling, as thoſe who are altogether without. The bond of Peace and Union was broken in Paradiſe, ſin diſſolved it, and broke off that nearneſſe and friendſhip with God, and from that day to this day, there hath been an infinite diſtance and ſeparation betwixt Man and God: The ſteps and degrees of it are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; There is darkneſſe and blindneſſe in mens minds: Such ignorance naturally poſſeſſeth the multitude, ſo that it wholly Alienats them from the Life of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 18. For what fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can Light, that pure Light, have with ſuch groſſe Darkneſſe as is among us? This certainly, is the removal of that Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe from our Souls, or the impoſition of the Clouds of tranſgreſſion, that makes it ſo dark a night in the Souls of Men. And then there is nothing but enmity and deſperate wickedneſſe in the heart of man, and this keeps the ſtrong hold of the Affections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. There cannot be a further elongation or ſeparation of the Soul from God, then to turn ſo oppoſite in all inclinations and diſpoſitions to his Holy Will: For the diſtance between God and us, is not local in the point of place; For whither ſhall we go from him who is every where? And thus he is near hand every one of us; but it is alſo real in the difformity and repugnancy of our Natures to his Holy Will. But add unto this, that being thus ſeparated in Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diſjoyned as it were, in natural Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, we cannot draw near to God in any Ordinance, as the Word, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Though
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:178706:35"/> we may, as that People, draw near with out lips, and aſk of him our duty, and ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to know him; Yet there is this natural incapacity and crookedneſſe in the heart of man, that it cannot truely approach unto the Father of Spirits, with any Soul deſire and delight. But <hi>their hearts are removed far from me,</hi> Iſa. 6. 9. Mat. 4. 12. I think men might obſerve, that their Souls act not in Religious buſineſſe as they ſhould; but that they remove their Souls ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Myles diſtant from their Bodies, and they cannot keep any conſtancy in this approach of Prayer to God, cannot walk with him in their Converſation, or carry him along in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation. But there is one point of eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſeparation ſuperadded to all, that there is no man can come near to God, without an Oblation and Offering of Peace; That there is no approaching to him, but as to a conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire, except we can bring a Sacrifice to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe, and a Preſent to pleaſe him for our infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite offences: There the difference ſtands, we cannot draw near to walk together, till we be agreed. And truely, this unto man is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for we have nothing ſo precious as the Redemption of our Souls, nothing can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe infinite Wrongs, or ſatiſfie infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Now this ſeems to make our nearneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain deſperate, and to put men furtheſt off from Hope.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, this is the very purpoſe of the Goſpel, Preached from the beginning of the World, to remove that diſtance, and to take impediments of meeting out of the way; For that great obſtruction, the want of a Sacrifice,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:178706:36"/> and Ranſome, the Lord hath ſupplied it, he himſelf hath furniſhed it: And it was the great deſigne carried on from the beginning of the World: But as the Sun, the nearer he is, the more the Earth is Enlightened, ſo here, firſt ſome dawning of Light appears, as a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Hope, to tell that the Redeemer ſhall come, that the True Sacrifice ſhall be ſlain; then ſtill the nearer his own appearing, the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are the Manifeſtations of him, and the great deſigne is more opened up, till at length he breaks out in Glory, from under a Cloud, and ſhews himſelf to the World, to be <hi>that Lamb of God that ſhould take away the ſins of the World.</hi> And now as the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes ſpeaks, Chap. 7. 19. <hi>The Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, by the which we draw nigh to God.</hi> All the Sacrifices and Shadows that were under the Law, did but point at this perfect Ranſom, and the way of acceſſe to God through a Mediator was not ſo clear, but now the matter is made as hopeful as is poſſible, the partition wall of the Lawes curſes, the hand-writting againſt us is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one the Croſſe, the enmity ſlain, the diſtance removed by the Blood of the Croſſe, being part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly filled up by his deſcent into our Nature, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his lower deſcent in our Nature to ſuffer Death. And this is the ſavoury Oblation that we have to preſent to God, and may have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to come nigh becauſe of it. And when once our acceſſe is made by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, then we are called and allowed to come ſtill nigher, to cleave and adhere to him as our Father, to pray unto him, to walk with him;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:178706:36"/> Then we ſhould converſe as Friends and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars together, then draw nigh to his Light for Illumination, and to him as the Fountain of Life, for quickening, to place our delight and deſire in him, to forſake all other things, even our Wills and Pleaſures, and to loſe them, that they may be found in his, to converſe much in his Company, and be often in Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, and Meditation upon him. This is the very deſigne and ſubſtance of the Goſpel, it holds forth the way of making up the breach between Man and God, of bringing you nigh who are yet afar off, and nearer who are near hand. Oh let us hearken to it.</p>

But by reaſon of mans fall into ſin, theſe are quite diſordered, and turned out of the right Channel; And therefore as the right improvement of them would make man happy: ſo the wrong imployment of them, loadens him with more real miſery, then any other creature: I mean, God hath given to man two notable Capacities, beyond other things, one is; to know and reflect upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to conſider what conveniency is in any thing towards himſelf, what goodneſſe or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage redounds to himſelf from them, and in that reflection and compariſon to enjoy what he hath. Another is to look forward, beyond the preſent time, and as it were, to anticipat and prevent the ſlow motions of time, by a kind of foreſight and providence. In a word, he is a Creature framed unto more underſtanding
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:178706:37"/> then others, and ſo capable of more joy in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things, and more foreſight of the time to come; He is made mortal, yet with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Spirit, of an immortal capacity, that hath its eye upon the morrow, upon eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now herein conſiſts either mans Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or Miſery, how he refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r the matter of his Joy and Gloriation, and what providence he hath for the time to come. If thoſe be rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, all is well; but if not, then woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, there is more hope of a beaſt then of him.</p>
               <p>Mans Nature inclines to boaſting, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in ſomething, and this ariſeth from ſome apprehended excellency or advantage, and ſo is originated in the underſtanding power of man, which is far above beaſts: Beaſts find the things themſelves, but they do not, they cannot reflect upon their own enjoyment of them; And therefore they are not capable of ſuch pleaſure: for the more diſtinct knowledge of things in relation to our ſelves, the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light enſueth upon it. Many Creatures have ſingular qualities and vertues, but they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the happier; For they know them not, and have no uſe of them, but are wholly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to the uſe of man, who therefore is only ſaid to enjoy them, becauſe he only is capable of joy from them. And this, I ſuppoſe, may give us a hint, at the abſolute incomprehenſible Bleſſedneſs, ſelf-complacency and delight of God; It cannot but be immeaſurably great, ſeing the knowledge of himſelf and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is infinite, he comprehends all his own
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:178706:38"/> Power and Vertue and Goodneſs; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Delight and Rejoycing is anſwerable. There is a glorying and boaſting then that is good, which man is naturally framed unto: And this is that which <hi>David</hi> expreſſes, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 34. 2. <hi>My Soul ſhall make her boaſt in God;</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 8. <hi>In God we boaſt all the day long, and praiſe thy name for ever.</hi> When the Soul appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends that All-ſufficiency, and ſelf-ſufficient fulneſſe of God; What infinite Treaſures of Goodneſſe, and Wiſdom and Power are in him, and ſo how ſutable and covenient he is to the condition of the Soul; What a ſweet correſpondence there is between his fulneſſe and our emptineſſe; His Mercy and our Miſery; His Infiniteneſſe and our unſutableneſſe, that there is in him to fill and overflow the Soul. The apprehenſion of this, cannot but in a manner perfume the Soul with delight. You find how the ſenſes are refreſhed, when they meet with their ſutable Object; How a pleaſant ſmell refreſheth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ent; How lively and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full colours are delightful to the eye. But much more here, God is the proportioned Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the immortal Spirit, he correſponds to all its capacities, and fills it with unconceivable ſweetneſs. But, my beloved, boaſting and glorying in him, ariſeth not only from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionableneſs and conveniency of him to our Spirits: but this muſt be ſuperadded, proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him. Things are loved, becauſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in themſelves, or becauſe they are our own. But we boaſt in nothing, we glory in nothing but becauſe it is both excellent in it ſelf, and ours beſides. It is the apprehended intereſt in any
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:178706:38"/> thing, makes the Soul riſe and lift up it ſelf after this manner, to have ſuch a one to be ours, ſuch a Lord to be our God, one ſo high and ſublime, one ſo univerſally full to be made over to thee; Here is the immediate riſe of the Souls Gloria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And truely as there is nothing can be ſo ſutable a portion, ſo there is nothing that can be ſo truely made ours as God; Of all things a believer hath, there is nothing ſo much his own as God, nothing ſo indiſſolubly tyed unto him, nothing ſo inſeparably joyned. See <hi>Pauls</hi> Triumph upon that account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can truely be ſaid to be the Souls own, but that which is not only Coaetaneous with it, that ſurvives mortality, and the changes of the Body; But likewiſe is inſeparable from it. What a poor empty ſound, is all that can be ſpoken of him, till your Souls be once poſſeſſed of him? It cannot make your hearts leap within you, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but excite and ſtirre up a Believers heart.</p>
               <p>Now there may be a lawful kind of Gloria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Rejoycing in the Works of God, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the firſt, which is a little ſtream from that greater River which runs out from it, and flows in to it again. A Soul that truely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends God, will take delight to view the Works of God, which make ſuch an expreſſion of him, and are a part of the magnificence of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father: But this is all in reference to him and not to our ſelves, for then it degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats and loſeth its ſweetneſſe, when once it turns the Channel towards the adorning of the Creature. True boaſting in God hath neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarly

The truth is, Natural man is mad, hath loſt his Judgement, and is under the greateſt diſtraction imaginable ſince the fall: That fall hath troubled his brains, and they are never ſetled, till the new Creation come to put all right again, and compoſe the heart of man. I ſay, all other diſtractions are but particular, in reſpect to particular things: But there is a generall diſtraction over all mankind, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to things of moſt general and moſt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concernment.

Now indeed ſo it is with us, ſince ſin entered, the Soul is wholly turned off God, the only true Object of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in which only there can be ſolid glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.

Oftentimes he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in that which is his ſhame, and boaſts in that which is his ſin, and which will cauſe nothing but ſhame, the more weight be laid upon it. There is in man an Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and forgetfulneſſe of God, and in this darkneſſe of the ignorance of God, every thing is apprehended or miſapprehended as preſent ſenſe ſuggeſts, and as it fancies a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency or excellency, thither the Soul is carried as if it were ſomething, and then it is but the eaſt Wind; There is nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide God that is a fit matter of boaſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it laikes one of the Eſſential Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; Either it is not ſuitable to the Soul, or it is not truely our own; There wants either proportion to the vaſt capacity and void of our deſires, and ſo cannot fill up that really, but only in a deluding dream or imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore will certainly make the iſſue rather vexation then gloriation; Or

               <p>AS man is naturally given to Boaſting and Gloriation in ſomething (for the Heart cannot want ſome Object to reſt upon and take complacency into, it is framed with ſuch a capacity of employing other things) ſo there is a ſtrong inclination in man towards the time to come, he hath an Immortal appetite, and an appetite of Immortality; and therefore his deſires uſually ſtretch farther then the preſent Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. And the more Knowledge he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other Creatures, the more Providence he hath and foreſight of the time to come. And ſo he often anticipats future things, by preſent Joy and Rejoycing in them, as he accelerats in a manner by his earneſt deſires and endeavours after them: Now if the Soul of man were in the Primitive Integrity, and had as clear and pearcing an Eye of Underſtanding as once it had, this Providence of the Soul would reach to the furtheſt period in Time; that is, to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, which is the only juſt meaſure of the endurance of any Immortal Spirit. But ſince the Eye of mans Underſtanding is darkneſſe, and his Soul diſordered, he cannot ſee afar
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:178706:45"/> off, nor ſo clearly, by far: He is now as you ſay Sand-blind, can ſee nothing at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as beyond the bounds of Time, can ſee nothing but at hand, <hi>to morrow,</hi> this is the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Sphere of poor mans comprehenſion; All he can attain unto, is to be provident for the preſent Time: I call it all preſent, even that which is to come of our Time; becauſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Eternity it hath no part, it hath no flux or ſucceſſion, it is ſo ſoon cut off as a moment, as the twinckling of an Eye: And ſo though a man could ſee the end of it, it is but a ſhort and dim ſight, it is as if a man could only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that which is almoſt contiguous with his Eye. Theſe then are the two great ruines and decayes of the Nature of man; He is degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from God to created things, and ſeeks his Joy and Reſt in them, in which there is nothing but the contrair; that is, vexation. And then he is fallen from apprehenſion of Eternity, and the poor Soul is confined within the narrow bounds of time; So that now all his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is to lay up ſome periſhing things for ſome few revolutions of the Sun, for ſome few morrows, after which, though an endleſſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row enſue, yet he perceives it not, and provides not for it; And all his Glorying and Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is only upon ſome preſumptuous confidence, and ungrounded aſſurance of the ſtability of theſe things for the time to come; which the Wiſe Man finding much folly in, he leaves us this Counſel, <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow,</hi> with a moſt pungent reaſon, taken partly from the inſtability and inconſtancy of all theſe outward
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:178706:46"/> things, in which men fancy an Eternity of Joy, and partly from the Ignorance we have of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events, <hi>For thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Boaſting is an evil ſo predominant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, that I know not any more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal in its Dominion, or more hurtful to us, or diſpleaſing to God. If it could be ſo embowel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, as that you might truely diſcern the many monſtrous conceptions of Atheiſm and Irreligion that are in it, it were worth the while. But I ſhall not digreſſe upon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral head, <hi>I</hi> had rather keep within the limits of the Text. Self-boaſting you ſee, is that which is here condemned, and the very Name is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt enough to condemn the Nature of it. But there is another particular added to reſtrict that, <hi>Of to morrow.</hi> Of all Boaſtings the moſt irrational and groundleſſe is that which ariſes from preſumption of future things, which are ſo uncertain both in themſelves and to us.</p>
               <p>It is worth the obſervation, that whatever be the immediat and particular matter and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of mens Gloriation, yet <hi>Self</hi> is the great and ultimat Object of it: It is <hi>Self</hi> that men Glory into, whatſoever created thing be the reaſon or occaſion of it. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to-morrow.</hi> Here we might ſtand and take a look of the crookedneſſe and perverſneſſe of mans Spirit, ſince his departure from God; Self-love and Pride were the firſt poyſon that the malice of Satan dropped into mans Nature, and this is ſo ſtrong and peſtilent, that it hath ſpread through the whole of mankind, and the whole
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:178706:46"/> in every man. Every one is infected, and all in every one. What are all the diſordered affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in men, but ſo many Streams from this Fountain? And from theſe do mens Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons flow next: So that there is nothing left uncorrupted, and free of this abominable and vile ingredient; All flowing from Self and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to it again, which is both ſacrilegious and unnatural. There is heinous Sacriledge in it, the ſpoyling of the Glorious Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, of his Indubitable Prerogative and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Right of all the Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Creature: There is no uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like this, for the Worm that crawls on the Footſtool, to creep up to the Throne, and as it were to King it there, to Deifie and Adore it ſelf, and gather in all the Tribute of Praiſe and Glory and Love, that is only due to the Lord God Almighty, and invert and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priat theſe to our ſelves; which is, as if the Axe ſhould boaſt it ſelf, as if it were no Iron, or the Staff, as if it were no Timber. Hence it is, that of all evils in mans Nature, God hath the moſt perfect Antipathy, and direct Oppoſition againſt Pride and Self-love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Sacriledge and Idolatry in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner, it ſtriks at the Soveraignty and Honour of Gods Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is dear to him as himſelf, it ſets up a vile Idol in the choiceſt Temple of God, that is in the Heart: And this is the Abomination of Deſolation: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evils ſtrike againſt his Holy Will: But this peculiarly points at the very Nature and Beeing of the moſt High God, and ſo it is with Child of Blaſphemy, Atheiſm is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:178706:47"/> heart and life of it. And then it is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and ſo monſtrous and deformed. For, conſider all the Creation, though every one of them have particular Inclinations towards their own proper ends, and ſo a Happineſſe ſuitable to their own Nature; yet how diverſe, how contrary ſoever they be, there is no ſelfiſhneſſe in them; They all concurre and conſpire to the good of the whole, and the mutual help of each other. If once that Poyſon ſhould infect the Material World, which hath ſpoyled the Spiritual, let once ſuch a ſelfiſh diſpoſition or inclination poſſeſſe any part of the World, and preſently the Order, Harmony, Beauty, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Profite of the whole World ſhould be Interrupted, Defaced and Deſtroyed. Let the Sun be ſuppoſed to boaſt it ſelf of its Light and Influence, and ſo diſdain to impart it to the lower World, and all would run into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Again I deſire you but to take a view of this Humour in anothers Perſon; (For we are more ready to ſee others evils then our own) and how deformed is it? So vile is ſelf-ſeeking and ſelf-boaſting, that all men loath it in others, and hide it from others: It diſgraces all Actions, how beautiful ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; It is the very bane of Humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that which looſes all the Linkes of it, and makes them croſſe and thwart one another.</p>
               <p>But, alas, how much more eaſie is it, to paint out ſuch an evil in a deformed Viſage, then to diſcern it in our ſelves? And how many will hate it in the Picture, who love
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:178706:47"/> and entertain it in their own perſons, ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe is intermingled with moſt deſperat wickedneſſe. I verily believe that is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant of every man good and bad, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in as far as it is mortified by Grace. O! the turnings and windings of the Heart upon it ſelf, in all the moſt apparently direct Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards God and the good of men? What ſerpentine and crooked Circumgyrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and reflections are there in the Soul of man, when the outward Action and Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeems moſt regular, and directed towards Gods Glory and others Edification? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of you have any acquaintance with your own Spirits, cannot but know this, and be aſhamed and confounded at the very thought of it. Self-boaſting; Self-complacency, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking, all thoſe being of Kin one to another, are inſinuated into your beſt Notions, and in fect them with more Atheiſm before God, then the ſtrongeſt pious Affection can inſtill of goodneſſe into them.

                  </gap>ly cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a habit of Condeſcendency and Self-denyal? And many may declaim with ſuch Zeal and Vehemency againſt this evil, and yet <hi>Latet anguis:</hi> The Serpent is in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and his venome may be diffuſed into the Heart, and the poyſon of Self-ſeeking and Self-boaſting, may run thorow the Veines of humble like Carriage and Paſſionate Diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for Self-denyal. Oh that we could above all things, eſtabliſh that Fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſtianity in our Hearts, even as we would be his Diſciples, truely and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:178706:48"/> and not in outward reſemblance, to deny our ſelves, to renounce our ſelves and our luſts, to make a whole Reſignation of our Love, Will, Glory and all to him, in whom to be loſt, it is only truely to find our ſelves.</p>
               <p>But though man have this ſtrange Self-ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing Humour, and a Self-glorying Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet he is ſo poor and beggarly a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he hath not ſufficient matter within himſelf, to give complacency to his Heart; therefore he muſt borrow from all external things; And when there is any kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in, or Title to them, then he Glories in himſelf for them, as if they were truely in himſelf. We are Creatures by Nature moſt indigent, yet moſt proud, which is unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. No man is ſatisfied within himſelf (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Good man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 14.) but he goes abroad to ſeek it at the Door of every Creature; And when there are ſome Plumes or Feathers borrowed from other Birds, like that fooliſh Bird in the Fable, we begin to raiſe our Criſts and boaſt our ſelves, as if we had all theſe of our own, and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to none. But as things that are truely our own, will not be ſufficient to feed this Flame of Gloriation, without the acceſſion of outward things: So preſent things and the preſent time will not afford Aliment enough or Fewel for this Humour, without the addition of the morrow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow.</hi> No mans preſent poſſeſſion ſatisfies him, without the addition of hope and expectation for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:178706:48"/> And herein the poverty of mans Spirit appears, and the emptineſſe of all things we enjoy here, that our preſent Revenue, as it were, will not content the Heart: The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Poſſeſſion fills not up the Vacuities of the Heart, without the ſupply of our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by taking ſo much in upon the head of the morrow, to ſpeak ſo: As one Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and Riotous Waſter, who cannot be ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his yearly incomes, but takes ſo much on upon his Eſtate, upon the next years in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, before it come, begines to ſpend upon it, before it come it ſelf, and then when it comes it cannot ſuffice it ſelf; So the inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable and indigent Heart of man cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and feed its Joy in Complacency upon the whole World, it it were preſently in its poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, without ſome acceſſion of hopes and expectations for the time to come. Therefore the Soul, as it were, Anticipats and Foreſtals the morrow, and borrows ſo much preſent Joy and Boaſting upon the head of it, which when it comes it ſelf, perhaps it will not fill the hand of the Reaper, let be pay for that Debt of Gloriation that was taken on upon its name, or compenſe the expectation was in it. See <hi>Job.</hi> 11. 18, 20. <hi>and</hi> 8. 13. Hope is like a mans houſe to him, but to many it is no better then a Spidders Web, We have then a clear Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the madneſſe and folly of men, who hang ſo much upon things without, and ſuffer themſelves to be Moulded and Modelled in their Affections, according to the variety of external Accidents; Frſt of all, conſider the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of all things upon us and our choice, there
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:178706:49"/> is nothing more unreaſonable, then to ſtirre our paſſions upon that which falls not under our deliberation, as the moſt part of things to come are: What ſhall be to morrow, what ſhall come of my Eſtate, of my places, what event my Projects and Deſignes ſhall have, this is not in my hand; Theſe depends upon other mens Wills, Purpoſes and Actions, which are not in my power; And therefore, either to Boaſt or Glory upon that which depends upon the concurrance of ſo many Cauſes Unſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat to me, or to be vexed and diſquieted upon the fore Apprehenſion of that which is not in my hand to prevent, it is not only Irreligious, as contrary to our Saviouts Command, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. But unreaſonable alſo, as that which even Nature condemns: <hi>Take not thought for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> and ſo by conſequent, <hi>Boaſt not of to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> And there's one Argument from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſuch Affections, <hi>Thou canſt not make one hair black, nor add one cubit to thy ſtature,</hi> &amp;c. To what purpoſe then, are either theſe Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Gloriations, which cannot prevent evil, nor procure good? Why ſhould our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons depend upon others Motions? This makes a man the greateſt Slave and Captive, ſo that he hath not the Dominion and Power of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But the vanity of ſuch. Affections is the more increaſed, if we conſider that Supreme Eternal Will, by which all theſe things are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; And therefore, it is in vain for Creatures to make themſelves more miſerable, or put themſelves in a Fools Paradiſe, which will produce more miſery after wards, and that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:178706:49"/> for theſe things, which are bound up in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Chain of his eternal purpoſe. Then in the next place, the folly of men appears from the inconſtancy of theſe things; there is ſuch an infinite variety of the Accidents of Providence, that it is folly for a man to preſume to boaſt of any thing, or take Complacency in it, becauſe many things fall between the Cup and the Lip, the Chalice and the Chin as the proverb is. There is nothing certain, but that all things are uncertain, that all things are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to perpetual Motion, Revolution and Change; To day a City; to morrow a Heap. And there is nothing between a great City and a Heap but one day; Nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Man and no Man but one hour: Our Life is ſubject to infinite Caſualities: It may receive the Fatal Stroak from the meaneſt thing, and moſt unexpected; it is a Buble flotting upon the Water; For this World is a wattery Element, in continual Motion with Storms, and in theſe, ſo many poor dying Creatures riſe up, and ſwime and float a while, and are toſſed up and down by the Wind and Vave, and the leaſt puff of Wind, or drop of Rain ſends it back to its own Element: We are a Vapour appearing for a very little time, a Creature of no ſolidity, a Dream, a Shadow and appearance of ſomething; And this Dream, or Apparition is but for a little t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:178706:50"/> in ſuch a continual Circumgyration, as a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive King who was drawing <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> Chariot, ſaid, when he was looking often behind him, the King of Aegypt <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> demanded, for what end did he look ſo often about him; Sayes he, I am looking to the Wheel, muſing upon the Viciſſitudes and Permutations of it, how the higheſt parts are inſtantly loweſt; And this word repreſſed the Kings vain Glory. Now in this conſtant Wheeling of outward things, which is the Soul, that enjoyes true quiet and peace? Even that Soul, that is fixed, as it were in the Center, upon God, that hath its abode in him: Though the parts without be in a continual violent Motion, yet the Center of the Wheel is at much peace, is not vioient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned, but gently complyes to the changes of the other. And then conſider the madneſſe of this, <hi>Thou knoweſt not,</hi> &amp;c. There are two Reaſons in the things themſelves, Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Independency on us; But this is al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As there is no more in our power, but the preſent hour, for to ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-day we are dead already, for it is paſt and cannot return, it is as it were buried in the Grave of Oblivion: And to morrow, we are not yet born, for it is not come to the Light, and we know not if ever it will come; So there is no more in our knowledge, but the preſent hour. The time paſt, though we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, yet it is without our practical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it admits of no Reformation by it: And
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:178706:50"/> the time to come, it is not born to us, and its all one as if we were not born to it. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the Lords diſpoſing of all Affairs under the Sun, after this Method, there is infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſſe both, though at the firſt view, men would think it better, that all things went on after an uniform manner; And that men knew what were to befal them; Yet I ſay, God hath herein provided for his own Glory and the Good of men: His own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, while he hath reſerved to himſelf, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Dominion, and perfect knowledge of his Works, and exerciſes them in ſo great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they may be ſeen to proceed from him; And for our good, for what place were there for the exerciſe of many Chriſtian Vertues and Graces, if it were not ſo?

Where ſhould Contentment and Tranquillity of Mind have place? For it is a Calme in a Storm properly, not a Calm in a Calm, that is no Vertue. If the ſeveral Accidents of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence were foreſeen by us, what a marvelous Perturbation and diſorder would it make in our Duty? Who would do his Duty out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Gods Command, to commit Events to him? Now there is the tryal of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>to make us go by a way we know not,</hi> and Reſigne our ſelves to <hi>All-ſeeing Providence, whoſe Eyes run too and fro throughout the earth.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:178706:51"/> that no Grace may want matter and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of exerciſe, that no Vertue may die out, for want of Fewel, or ruſt for lack of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, God hath thus Ordered and Diſpoſed the World. There is no Condition, no Poſture of Affairs, in which he hath not left a fair Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, for the exerciſing of ſome Grace: Hath he ſhut up and precluded the Acting of one or many through Affliction, then ſurely he hath opened a wide Door, and given large matter for Self denyal, Humility, Patience, Moderation; And theſe are als precious, as any that look faireſt. In a word, I think the very Frame and Method of the diſpoſing of this Material World, ſpeaks aloud to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. You ſee, when you look below, there is nothing ſeen but the outſide of the Earth, the very Surface of it only appears, and there your ſight is terminated; But look above, and there is no termination, no bounding of the Sight, there are infinite ſpaces, all are Tranſparant and Clear without and within. Now what may this repreſent unto us: One ſayes, it ſhews us that our Affections ſhould be ſet upon things above, and not on things below, ſeeing below there is nothing but an outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Surface of things, the Glory and Beauty of the Earth is but skin deep; But Heavenly things are alike throughout, all Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, nothing to ſet bounds to the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are infinite, and you may enlarge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly towards them. I add this other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that God hath made all things in Time, Dark and Opake, like the Earth: look

But Eternity is both Tranſparent and Conſpicuous throughout, and infinite too. Therefore God hath made us blind to the one, that we ſhould not ſet our heart, nor ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat our eyes upon any thing here; But he hath opened and ſpread Eternity before us in the Scriptures, ſo that you may read and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand your Fortune, your everlaſting Eſtate in it. He hath ſhut up Temporal things and Sealed them, and wills us to live implicitly, and give him the Truſt of them without anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foreſight; But Eternity he hath unvail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and opened unto us. Certain it is, that no man till he be fully poſſeſſed of God, who is an All-ſufficient Good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. Can find any ſatisfaction, in any preſent Enjoyment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the addition of ſome hope for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Great things without it will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; for what is it all to a man, if he have no aſſurance for the time to come, and mean things with it, will content: Great things with little hope and expectation, fill with more Vexation inſtead of Joy, and the greater they be, this is the more increaſed. Again, mean and low things, with great hopes and large expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations will give more ſatisfaction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all mankind have a look toward the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and labour to ſupply their preſent defects and wants with hope or confidence of that. <hi>I</hi> would exhort you who would indeed have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid matter of Gloriation, and would not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooled
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:178706:52"/> into a golden Dream of vain expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of vain things, that ye would labour to fill up the Vacuities of preſent things, with that great Hope, the Hope of Salvation, which will be as an Helmet to keep your head ſafe in all difficulties, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. It is true, other mens expectations of Gain and Credit, and ſuch things; Do in ſome meaſure, abait the torment and pain of preſent wants and indigencies: But certain it is, that ſuch hope is not ſo Soveraign a Cordial to the heart, as to expell all grief, but leaves much vexation within: But then alſo, the frequent diſappointment of ſuch projects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Gain, Honour and Pleaſure, and the extreme unanſwerableneſſe of theſe to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Hopes of the Soul, even when attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſts needs breed infinite more anxiety and vexation in the Spirit, then the hope of them could give of ſatisfaction; Yea, the more the expectation was, it cannot chooſe, but the greater ſhame and confuſion muſt be. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you would have your Souls truely eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and not hanging upon the morrow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly, as the moſt part of men are, get a look beyond the morrow, unto that everlaſting Day of Eternity, that hath no morrow after it; <hi>And ſee what foundation you can lay up for that time to come,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy</hi> counſel the Rich Men in the World, who thought their Riches and Revenues, their Offices and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, a Foundation and VVell-ſpring of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to them and their Children, and are ready to ſay with that man in the Parable, <hi>Soul</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:178706:52"/> 
                  <hi>take thy reſt, thou haſt enough laid up for many years. Charge them,</hi> (ſayes he,) &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16, 17, 18, 19. O! a Charge worthy to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on the Tables of our hearts; worthy to be written on the Ports of all Cities, and the Gates of all Palaces. You would all have a Foundation of laſting Joy, ſayes he; But why ſeek you laſting Joy in fadeing things? And certain Joy in uncertain Riches, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Contentment in empty things, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Living God, who is the inexhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spring of all Good things? Therefore, if you would truely boaſt of to Morrow, or ſing a ſolide Requiem to your own hearts; There is another Treaſure to be laid up in ſtore againſt the time to come; The Time only worthy to be called Time, that is Eternity; And that is, ſtudy to do good, and be rich in good Works, in VVorks of Piety, of Mercy, of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, of Sobriety. This is a better Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Time to come; Or rather receive and embrace the Promiſe of eternal Life, made to ſuch, that free and gracious promiſe of Life in the Goſpel; And ſo you may ſupply all the wants and indigencies of your preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, with the precious hope of eternal Life which cannot make aſhamed. But what is the way that the moſt part of men take to mitigate and ſweeten their preſent hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips? Even like that of the fools in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. They either have ſomething laid up for many years, or elſe their projects and deſignes reach to many years: The truth is, they have more pleaſure in the expectation
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:178706:53"/> of ſuch things, nor in the real poſſeſſion, but that pleaſure is but imaginary either. How many thoughts and deſignes are continually turning in the heart of man, how to be rich, how to get greater gain, or more credit: Men build Caſtles in the Air, and fancy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it were, new VVorlds of meer poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible beings, and in ſuch an imployment of the heart, there is ſome poor deceiving of preſent ſorrows, but at length they recurre with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er violence. Every man makes <hi>Romanſes</hi> for himſelf, pretty fancies of his own Fortune, as if he had the diſpoſing of it himſelf; He ſits down, as it were, and writes an Almanack and Prognoſtication in his own ſecret thoughts, and deſignes his own Proſperity, Gain and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and Pleaſures or Joyes; And when we have thus ranked our Hopes and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then we begin to take complacency in them, and boaſt our ſelves in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of them, as if there were not a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Lord who gives a Law to our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, als immediatly, as to the VVinds and Raines.</p>
               <p>Now that you may know the folly of this, Conſider the Reaſon which is ſubjoyned, <hi>For thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> There is a concurrence of inconſtancy in all things, and ignorance in us, which might be ſufficient to check our folly of confident and preſumptuous expectation from them, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation in them: So that whether we look about us to the things themſelves, or within us to our ſelves, all things proclaim the folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:178706:53"/> of that which the heart of man is ſet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. And this double conſideration the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James</hi> oppoſes to the vain hopes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident undertakings of men, Chap. 4. 13. <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Which place is a perfect Commentary upon this Text: He brings in an inſtance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and purpoſes of rich men, for the compaſſing of Gain by Merchandiſe, whereby you may underſtand all the ſeveral deſignes and plots of men, that are contrived and ordered, and laid down in the hearts of men, either for more Gain, or more Glory, or more Pleaſure and Eaſe. Now the Grand Evil that is here reproved, is not ſimply mens Care and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in uſeing Lawful means for their acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation in this life, or yet their Wiſe and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent foreſight in ordering of their Affairs for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that end, for both theſe are frequently recommended and commended by the VViſe Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 6. and 24. 27. But here is the great Iniquity, that men in all theſe contrivings and actings, carry themſelves as if they were abſolute Independents, without conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soveraign Univerſal Dominion of God. No man almoſt reflects upon that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Being, which alone hath the Negative and Definitive Sentence in all the Motions and Affairs of the ſons of men, or conſiders, that it is not in man that walks, to direct his paths, that when all our thoughts and deſigns are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled and Ordered, and the compleateſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made for reaching our intended ends, that yet the way of man is not in himſelf; That all theſe things are under a higher and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:178706:54"/> more abſolute Dominion of the moſt High God. VVhoſe heart doth that often ſound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? <hi>A mans heart deviſeth his way, but the Lord directs his ſteps:</hi> And ſo is not bound by any rule to conform his Executions to our Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; For he works all according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his own VVill and not ours; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder that the product of our Actions do not anſwer our intentions and devices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Supream Rule and Meaſure of them is above our Power and without our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And therefore, though there were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many devices in the heart of man, never ſo wiſely or lawfully Contrived and Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Though the Mine be never ſo well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and all ready for the fireing of it: <hi>Yet the Counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand, Prov.</hi> 19. 21. &amp; 16, 9. That higher determination may blow up our beſt conſultations or drown them, for mans goings is of the Lord, how then can a man underſtand his Paths, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 24. And yet the moſt part of men in all theſe things loſſe the remembrance of this fatal and invincible Subordination to God, and propoſe their own Affairs and Actions, as if themſelves were to diſpoſe of them; And when their own reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and projects ſeem probable, they begin to pleaſe themſelves in them, in the fore-thought of what they will do, or what they may have or enjoy to morrow afterward: There is a preſent ſecret Complacency and Gloriation, without any ſerious reminding the abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of all things upon the VVill of God, and their independence upon our Counſels,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:178706:54"/> without fore-caſting and often ruminating up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perpetual fluctuation and conſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of humane Affairs, but as if we were the Supream Moderators in Heaven and Earth, ſo we Act and Tranſact our own buſineſſe in a deep forgetfulneſſe of him who ſits in Heaven and laughs at all our Projects and Practic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. And therefore, the Holy Ghoſt would have this ſecret but ſerious thought to ſeaſon all our other Purpoſes and Conſultations, <hi>If the Lord will,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas we ought to ſay and think this, it is ſcarce minded: And then we know not what ſhal be to Morrow, for our Life it ſelf is a Vapour. Herein is a ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you lay your deſignes for to Morrow, for a Year, for many Years, and yet ye know not, if ye ſhall be to Morrow. How many mens Projects are caſt beyond that time that is meaſured out in Gods Counſel: And what a ridiculous thing muſt that be to him, if it be not done with ſubmiſſive and humble dependence on him. In a word, Time is with Child of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable things, conceived by the Eternal Counſel of God; Infinite and inconceiveably Various are theſe Conceptions which the Womb of Time ſhall at length bring forth to Light; Every Day, every Hour, every Minute is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in pain, as it were, and is delivered of ſome one Birth or another, and no Creature can open its Womb ſooner, or ſhut it longer then the appointed and prefixed Seaſon; There is no miſcarying as to him whoſe Decrees do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly conceive them, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:178706:55"/> the Alluſion full, as long as they are carried in the Womb of Time, they are hid from all the World; The Womb is a dark Lodging, and no Underſtanding nor Eye can pierce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, to tell what is in it, till it break forth; And therefore, Children born are ſaid to come to the Light: for till then, they are to us in a Cloud of darkneſſe, that we cannot tell what they are; So then; every Day, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Hour, every Moment is about to bring forth that which all the World is ignorant of, till they ſee it; And Oh that then they underſtood it. We know not whether the Morrows or next Hours Birth may be a proportioned Child, or a Monſter, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will anſwer the Figure and Mould that is in our mind, or be miſhapen and deformed to our Senſe. Mans deſires and deſignes may be ſaid to conceive, for they form an inward Image and Idea within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to which they labour to make the Product and Birth of Time conformable; And when it anſwers our preconceived form, then we rejoyce as for a Man-child. But for the moſt part it is a Monſter as to our Conception, it is an Aberration from our Rule; It is either mutilate and defective of what we deſire, or ſuperfluous or deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which turns our expectation into vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our boaſting into lamentation. But the truth is, Time brings forth no Monſters as to the Lords Decrees, which are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt meaſures of all things: It may be ſaid of every thing under the Sun, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>

               <p>IT is ſtrange to think what Mercy is mixed with the moſt Wrath-like Stroaks and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; There is no Prophet whoſe Office and Commiſſion is only for Judgment: Nay to ſpeak the truth, it is Mercy that premiſes Threatnings. The entering of the Law both in the Commands and Curſes, is to make ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound that Grace may ſuperabound; So that both Rods and Threatnings are the Meſſengers of Jeſus Chriſt to bring ſinners to him for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Every thing ſhould be meaſured and named by its end; So, call Threatnings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, call Rods and Judgements Mercies; Name all good, and good to you, if ſo be ye underſtand the purpoſe of God in theſe. The ſhorteſt Preaching in the Bible uſeth to expreſſe it ſelf what it means, though it be never ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. This is a ſad and lamentable beginning of a Prophets Miniſtery; The firſt word is <hi>to the Heavens and to the Earth.</hi> A weighty and horrible regrate of this People, as if none of them were to hear, as if the Earth could be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:178706:56"/> more eaſily affected then they. The Creatures are taken witneſſes by God of their ingratitude, and then who ſhall ſpeak for them: If Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth be againſt them, who ſhall ſpeak good of them? Will their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? No certainly, it will in the day of Witneſſing and Judging precipitate its ſentence, and ſpare the Judge the labour of probation; A mans enemy ſhall be within his own houſe, though now your Conſciences agree with you: Nay, why doth the Lord ſpeak to them? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the People conſider not, becauſe Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences have given over ſpeaking to them; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord directs his Word to the dumb Earth: Yet how gracious is he, as to direct a ſecond word even to the People, though a ſad word.

If the Lord would threaten a man with pure and unmixed Judgements, if he would frame a threatning of a Rod of pure Juſtice, I think it ſhould be this, I will no more reprove thee, nor chaſten thee; And he is not far from it, when he ſayes, why ſhall ye be ſtricken any more, <hi>&amp;c. verſ.</hi> 5. As if he would ſay, it is in vain now to ſend a Rod, ye receive no correction; I ſent the Rod that it might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your hearts and eares to the Word, and ſeal your inſtruction, but to what purpoſe is it? Ye grow worſe and worſe: Well, the Prophet campares here Sin and Judgement, and the one far ſurmounts the other. Ye would think a deſolate Countrey, burnt Cities, Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation made by Strangers, a ſufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:178706:57"/> of their corruption and miſorders, of their forſaking and backſliding. Ye would think now, if your preſent condition and the Lands preſſed you to utter <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> Lamentation, a ſadder then which is not almoſt imaginable, ye would think I ſay, that you had received double for all your ſins: And yet alas, how are your iniquities of infinite more deſert: All that were Mercy, which is behind infinite and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment: that there is room left for complaint, it is Mercy: that there is a remnant left, it is Mercy.</p>

               <p>This is a ſtrange Preface going before this Preaching, and more ſtrange in that it is before the firſt Preaching of a young Prophet, He ſpeakes both to Rulers and People, but he gives them a name, ſuch as certainly they would not take to themſelves, but ſeing he is to ſpeak the Word of the Lord, he muſt not flatter them, as they did themſelves. Is not this the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his Portion and Inheritance which he choſe out of the Nations? Are not theſe Rulers the Princes of <hi>Judah</hi> and the Lords Anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Were they not both in Covenant with God, and ſeparated from the Nations both in Priviledges and Profeſſion? How then are they <hi>Rulers of Sodom, and People of Gomorrah?</hi> Likned to the worſt of the Nations; And not likened to them, but ſpoken off, as if they were indeed all one. When ye hear the Preface, ye would think that the Prophet were about to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his ſpeech to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah:</hi> But when ye look upon the Preaching, ye find he means by <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and theſe are

Their deſigne is to eſtabliſh their Houſe, and make it Eminent, but they take a compendious way to ſhame and ruine it. Alas it is too publick that Rulers ſeek their own things, for themſelves and their freinds: And for Jeſus and his Intereſts, they are not concerned? But are ye the people any whit better? Oh that it were ſo. But alas, when ye are involved in the ſame guiltineſſe, I fear ye partake of their plagues. VVhat are ye then? <hi>People of Gomorrab.</hi> Is not the Name of God blaſphemed dayly becauſe of you? Are not the abominations of the Gentiles the common diſeaſe of the multitude, and the very reproach of Chriſtianity. Set apart your publick ſervices and profeſſions, and is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing behind in your Converſation, but Drunkeneſſe, Lying, Swearing, Contention, Envy, Deceit, VVrath, Covetouſneſſe, and ſuch like? Have not the multitude of them been als civil, and carried themſelves als blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, and without Offence, as the throng of our Viſible Church? What have ye more then they? It is true, ye are caled Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and ye boaſt in it. Ye know his will, and can ſpeak of points of Religion, can Teach and Inſtruct others, and ſo hath, as it were, in your minds a form and method of Knowledge, the beſt of you are but ſuch: But I ask, as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Jews in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Thou that teacheſt another teacheſt thou not thy ſelf, thou that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt a boaſt of the Law; throw breaking of it, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureſt thou God,</hi> Rom. 2. 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 23. Why
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:178706:59"/> then, certainly all thy profeſſion and baptiſm avails nothing, and will never extract the from the Pagans, with whom thou art one in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; Thy profeſſion is ſo far from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee in ſuch a caſe, that it ſhall be the moſt bitter ingredient in thy Cup of Judgment, for it is the greateſt Aggravation of thy ſin, for through it, Gods Name is Blaſphemed; <hi>If they had not known, they had not had ſin.</hi> Pagans ſin is no ſin in reſpect of Chriſtians: If ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Chriſts Sermon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. Ye will ſay, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is a meak and moderate man in regard of him; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls them people of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> but Chriſt will have them worſe, and their Judgment more intolerable then theirs. And that not only the profane of them, but the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Religious like, who believed not in him: VVell then, here is the advantage ye get of your Name of Chriſtianity, of your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of hearing his VVord dayly; Ye who never ponder it, to tremble at it, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, who cannot be moved either to joy or grief for Spiritual things; Neither Law nor Goſpel moves the moſt part of you; I ſay here is all your gain, ye ſhall receive a reward with Gentiles and Pagans; Yea, ye ſhall be in a worſe caſe nor they in the Day of the Lord. The civil Chriſtian ſhall be worſe then the profane Turke, and ye ſhall not then boaſt that ye were Chriſtians, but ſhall deſire that ye had dwelt in the place where the Goſpel had never been preached: It is a Character of the Nations, <hi>that they call not on God,</hi> and of Heathen Families, <hi>that they pray not to him,</hi> Jer.

Doth not every one of you, as you have power in your hand, oppreſſe one another? wrong one another? Now our end in ſpeaking thus to you, is not to drive you to deſparation: No indeed, but as there was a word of the Lord ſent to ſuch by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſo we bring a word unto you. That which ruines you, is your carnal confidence; Ye are preſumptuous as this people, and cryes, <hi>the Temple of the Lord,</hi> the VVork of the Lord, &amp;c. as if theſe would ſave you: Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all theſe will never cover you in the day of wrath; Know there is a neceſſity to make peace with God, and your righteouſneſſe muſt exceed the righteouſneſſe of a profeſſion and external priviledges and duties, or elſe ye ſhall be as far from the Kingdome of Heaven as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> VVe ſpeak of Rulers ſins, that ye may mourn for them, leſt ye be Judged with them; If ye do not

               <p>THis is the Word he calls them to hear, and a ſtrange Word. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> asks, what means your ſacrifices? God will not have them.

Is he not repealing the Statute and Ordinance he had made in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> If he had reproved us for breach of Commands, for Omiſſion and Neglect of Sacrifices, we would have taken with it; But what means this reproof for well doing?

This is a Myſtery, and we ſhall endeavour to unfold it to you from the World. It concerns us to know how God is pleaſed with our publick Services and Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: For the moſt part of people have no more Religion. Ye all, I know, deſire to know what True Religion is: Conſult the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and ſearch them, for there ye ſhall find E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life. We frame to our ſelf a wrong Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern and Coppy of it, and ſo we judge our ſelves wrong. Our narrow Spirits do not take in the Latitude of the Scriptures Religion, but taking in one part, it excludes another, and thinks God rigid if it be not taken of our hand ſo. But I pray conſider theſe three things, which ſeem to make up the good Old Way, the Religion of the Old and New Teſtament. Firſt, Religion takes in all the Commands, it is univerſal, <hi>hath reſpect to all the Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119. 6. It carries the two Tables in both-hands, the firſt Table in the right hand, and the ſecond in the left. Theſe are ſo intirely conjoyned, that if ye receive not both, ye cannot receive any true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Secondly, it takes in all the man, his Soul and Spirit als well as his Body: Nay, it principally includes that which is principal in the man, <hi>his Soul and Spirit, his Mind and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> If ye divide theſe, ye have not a man preſent but a body: And what fellowſhip can bodies have with him who in a Spirit: If ye divide theſe among themſelves, ye have not a Spirit indeed preſent; If the mind be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:178706:63"/> ſurely the heart cannot, but if the mind be, and the heart away, Religion is not Religion, but ſome empty Speculation; The mind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve but by the heart: Where the heart is, there a man is reckoned to be. Thirdly, it takes in Jeſus Chriſt as all, and excludes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a mans ſelf. <hi>He worſhips God in the Spirit,</hi> but he rejoyces not in himſelf and in his ſpirit, <hi>but in Jeſus Chriſt, and hath no confidence in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or the fleſh</hi> phil. 3. 3, 8. It includes the Soul and Spirit, and all the Commands, but it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes them all, and embraces Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, as the only Object of glorying into, and truſting into. All a mans ſelf becomes droſs in this Conſideration. Now the firſt of theſe is drawn from the laſt, therefore it appears firſt; I ſay, an indeavour in walking in every thing Commanded, of conforming our way to the preſent rule and patern, is a ſtream flowing from the pure heart within: A mans Soul and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections muſt once be purified, or it ſend out ſuch Streams in Converſation. And from whence doth that pure heart come? Is it the Fountain and Original? No certainly; <hi>The heart is deſperately wicked above all things,</hi> and how will it cleanſe it ſelf? But this purity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from another Fountain, from Faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: And it is this, that lies neareſt the uncreated Fountain Chriſt himſelf, it is the moſt immediat Conduit, the Mouth of the Fountain, or the Bucket to draw out of the deep Wells of Salvation: All theſe are conjoyned in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>The end of the Command is love.</hi> Ye know Love is ſaid elſewhere to be the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:178706:63"/> of the Law: And when we ſay Love, we mean all Duties to God and man, which Love ought immediately to principle. Now this Love proceeds from a pure Heart, cleanſed and ſanctified, which pure heart proceeds from Faith unfeigned. So then, we muſt go up in our ſearching from external obedience all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, till we arrive at the inward Fountain of Chriſt dwelling in us by Faith: And then have ye found true Religion indeed. Now ye may think poſſibly, we have uſed too much cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution; What is all this to the preſent purpoſe? Yes very much. Ye ſhall find the Lord rejecting this peoples publick Worſhip and ſolemn Ordinances, upon theſe three grounds, either they did not joyn with them the obſervation of weightier Commands, or they did not worſhip him in them with their Spirits, had not Souls preſent, or they knew not the end and uſe for which God had appoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Sacrifices and Ceremonies, they did not ſee to the end of all, which was Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

Meaning eertainly, who required them for ſuch an end, to take away your ſin; who required them but as a ſhadow of the ſubſtance to come? Who required them but as ſignes of that Lamb and Sacrifice to be offered up in the fullneſſe of time? And for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ye paſſe over all theſe, and think to pleaſe me with the external Ceremony, was that ever my intent or meaning?

The moſt part of Chriſtians are guilty here: We come to the Ordinances, as it were to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a Cuſtome, and perform a Ceremony, that we may have it to ſay to our Conſcience, that it is done, and there is no more intent and purpoſe.

This is the greater half, if not the whole of Religion, Love to Jeſus Chriſt who loved us, and living to him, becauſe he died for us, and livihg to him, becauſe we love him. Now all our Ordinances and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhould be Channels to cary our Love to him, and occaſions of venting our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord rejected this peoples ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, becauſe they were exact and punctual in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:178706:67"/> them, and neglected other parts of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; And this is clearly expreſſed here. <hi>I will not hear your prayers,</hi> though there be many of them: Why? <hi>Your hands are full of blood.</hi> Ye come to worſhip me, and pray to me; and yet there are many Abominations in your Converſation, which you continue in, and do not challenge in your ſelves. Ye have unclean hands, and ſhall your prayer be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which ſhould come up with pure Hands? They took his Covenant in their mouth, and offered many Sacrifices, but what have ye to do with theſe things (ſayeth the Lord) ſince ye hate to be reformed, ſince ye hate perſonal Reformation of your Lives, and in your Families? what have ye to do to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be my people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50, 19, 17? The Lord requires an univerſality, if ye would prove ſincerity: If ye have reſpect to any of his Commands, as his Commands, then will ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect all. If ye be partial, and chooſe one Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is eaſy and refuſe another harder; ye will come to the Church and hear, but ye will not pray at home; Ye will faſt in publck, but not in private: Then <hi>(ſayes the Lord)</hi> ye do not at all obey me, but your own humour; ye do not at all faſt unto me, but unto your ſelves; As much as your intereſt lyes in a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo much are ye carried to it: And <hi>I</hi> take this to be the reaſon, why many are ſo Eager in purſuing publick Ordinances, following Communions, and Conferences with Gods people, ready to Pray in publick rather then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: If ye would follow them into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:178706:67"/> Chamber, how much indifferency is there? how great infrequency, how little fervency? VVell <hi>(ſayes the Lord)</hi> did ye pray to me when ye prayed among others? No, ye prayed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to your ſelves, or the company, or both. Did ye ſeek me in a Communion? No, <hi>(ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord)</hi> ye ſought not me, but your ſelves: If ye ſought me indeed with others, ye would be als earneſt if not more, to ſeek me alone, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 6. And again, the Lord eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the weightier matters of the Law to be conſidered; As it was among the Jews, their Ceremonies were commanded, and ſo good, but they were not ſo much good in themſelves, as becauſe they were means appointed for another end and uſe. But the Moral Law was binding in it ſelf, and good in it ſelf, without relation to another thing. And therefore Chriſt lays this heavy Charge to the Phariſees; <hi>Ye tithe mint and aniſe,</hi> Mat. 23. 23. <hi>Woe unto you, for ye neglect the weightier matters of the Law, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mercy and Faith, theſe ye ought to have done, and not left the other undone.</hi> Are there not many who would think it a great fault, to ſtay away from the Church on the Sabbath or Week day, and yet will not ſtick to ſwear, to drink often; <hi>VVoe unto you, for ye ſtrain at a gnat and ſwallow a camel.</hi> Therefore are the Prophets full of theſe Expoſtulations: The people ſeemed to make Conſcience of Ceremonies and External Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but they did not order their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright; They did not execute Judgment and relieve the oppreſſed, did not walk ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, did not mortify ſinful luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas, we
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:178706:68"/> deceive our ſelves with the noiſe of a Covenant, and a Cauſe of God, we cry it up, as an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dot againſt all evils, uſe it as a charm, even as the Jews did their Temple; and in the mean time, we do not care how we walk before God, or with our Neighbours: Well, (thus ſaith the Lord) <hi>Truſt ye not in lying words,</hi> Jer. 7. 4, 5, 6. If drunkenneſs reign among you, if fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, ſwearing, oppreſſion, cruelty reign among you, your Covenant is but a ly, all your profeſſions are but lying words, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver keep you in your Inheritances and Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. The Lord tells you what he requires of you, <hi>Is it not to do juſtly, and walk humbly with God?</hi> Mic. 6. 7. This is that which the grace of God teaches, <hi>To deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your God, your neighbour and your ſelf,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. And this he prefers to your publick Ordinances, your Faſting, Covenanting, Preaching and ſuch like. <hi>Is not this to know me</hi> (ſaith the Lord) Jer. 22. 15. 16. You think you know God, when you can diſcourſe well of Religion, and intertain conferences of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Caſes; You think it is knowledge to underſtand Preachings and Scripture. But thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>To do juſtly to all men, to walk humbly towards God, to walk ſoberly in your ſelves,</hi> is more real knowledge of God, then all the Volumes of Doctors contain, or the heads of Profeſſors. Is this knowledge of God, to have a long flowriſhing diſcourſe, containing much Religion in it? Alas no; to do juſtly, to oppreſs none, to pray more in ſecret, to walk
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:178706:68"/> humbly and ſoberly, this is to know the Lord; practice is real knowledge indeed, it argues, that what a man knows, he receives in love, that the Truth hath a deep impreſſion on the heart, that the Light ſhines into the heart, to inflame it. What is knowledge before God? As much as principles Affection and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as much as hath Influence on your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations: If you do not, and love not what you know, is that to know the Lord?

               <p>If Religion do not include the Goſpel, we are yet upon the old Covenant of Works, according to which, none can be juſtified; If it do not include the Law in the Hands of a Mediator, then <hi>we turn the Grace of god unto wantonneſs,</hi> If

                  </gap>ſus Chriſt is that clean water that he muſt ſprinkle on you; if you would be clean. If you take any other water, any other righteouſneſs but his, and waſh thy ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſuppoſe it be ſnow water that waſheth cleaneſt, thy moſt exact converſation, yet <hi>he will plunge thee in the mire, till thy own cloaths abhore thee</hi> Job 9. 30, 31. Now when ye have waſhed your perſons, <hi>ye need not ſave to waſh your feet,</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) your dayly converſation, reform it in the vertue of that blood, for <hi>we are not called to uncleanneſs but unto holineſs.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Put away the evil of yoor doings,</hi> &amp;c. God hath put away the guilt of your doings by Juſtification; now put ye away the evil of your doings by

Ye that are cleanſed by this blood, O! think how unbeſeeming it is to you, to defile your ſelves again with theſe things ye are cleanſed from: But now, <hi>learn to do well:</hi> ye are given up to Chriſt, ye muſt be his Diſciples, and he will teach you: <hi>Learn of me</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) you need no other law almoſt but his example; he is a viſible and ſpeaking law, yet <hi>ſeek Judgement,</hi> As ye ought to look on my example; ſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ponder that word and rule of practice and behaviour that <hi>I</hi> have left behind me and given out as the law-giver of the redeemed: have I redeemed you? And ſhould not I be the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ranſomed ones King? Is there any ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in the world wants a law, order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? neither muſt ye who are delivered from bondage, enfranchiſed, and made free indeed. Now ye ſhould of all men moſt live by a law. And when ye know that rule, then apply it to your ſeveral vocations and callings: let the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrat act according to it, and every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it: Religion conſiſts not in a general notion, but condeſcends to our particular pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to reform it. You ſee then what we would preſſe upon your Conſciences. It is true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we would have you perſwaded unto. All men have ſome kind of Religion, even Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens who worſhip Idols; but the true religion reſpects the true and living God. Now what is it to worſhip the true and living God? what is the ſervice of him, that may be called Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:178706:70"/> indeed? Should we be the preſcrivers of it? No certainly, he muſt carve ſolely in that or elſe it cannot pleaſe him. Therefore <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtemony:</hi> if ye ſpeak not according to this, and worſhip not according to this word of God, it is becauſe there is no light into you. Ye may have a religion before men pure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, but if it be not ſo before God and the father, I pray you to what purpoſe is it? I am ſure it is all loſt labour, nay it is labour with loſs, inſtead of gain. O that ye were perſwaded to look and ſearch the Scriptures: Think ye to have eternal life out of them? and think ye to have eternal life by them, who do not labour to know the way of it ſet down there? Every on of you have a different model of religion according to your fancies and breedings, according as your luſts will ſuffer you: The rule that the moſt part walk by is the courſe and example of the world. Is not this darkneſſe, and groſſe darkneſs? Others model their duties according to their ability, they will do all they can do with eaſe, and without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves, and they think God may be well pleaſed with that. I pray you conſider and hear the word of the Lord, and Law of your God; hath he ſet down here the rule and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect patern of true Religion, and will ye never ſo much own it, as to examine yours according to it? the ſcriptures are the touch-ſtone; If you would not have a counterfeit Religion deceiving you in the end when ye have truſted to it, I pray you try it by the word of God. Oh that this principle were once ſunk into your hearts, <hi>I</hi> may not walk at randome, if <hi>I</hi> pleaſe my ſelf, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:178706:71"/> ſatiſfy my own will, if that be not alſo Gods will, I ſhall have neither gain nor comfort of it, his will is manifeſted in his word, I will ſearch and find what God hath required of me, for if I be not certain of his will, I may be doing all my dayes, and ſweating out my life, and yet loſſe my pains and oyl. I ſay this word of the Lord that Iſaiah calls to the people to hear V. 10. will at length judge you. Your Religion will be tryed in the day of accompts according to it, not according to your rules and methods ye have preſcribed unto your ſelves. Now if ye in the mean time ſhall judge your ſelves according to another rule, and ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>olve your ſelves, and in the end God ſhall judge you according to this word and condemn you, were ye not fools in neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this word.</p>
               <p>The whole will of God concerning your duty may be ſummed up in two; John hath one of them, 1 Jo. 3. 23. <hi>And this is his Commandment, that we ſhoud believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another, as he gave us Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And Paul hath another to the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians. 1 Theſ. 4. 3. <hi>This is the wiil of God, even your ſanctification.</hi> And theſe two make up this text, ſo that it units both Goſpel and Law. The Commandment of the Law comes forth, and it is found that we have broken, and are guilty, that we cannot anſwer for one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; the Law entring makes ſin abound, our inability, yea impoſſibility of obedience is more diſcovered: well then, the Goſpel proclames the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for the Saviour of ſinners, and commands us
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:178706:71"/> under pain of damnation to believe in him, to caſt our ſouls on him, as one able to ſave, as one who hath obeyed the Law for us; ſo that this command of believing in Chriſt is anſwerable to all the breaches of the Law, and tends to make them up in Chriſt. When he proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with terrour, that which ye hear expreſt is not his firſt Comand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ye are in the firſt inſtance to obey, for all theſe we have broken; but it hath a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-command in its boſome, it leads to Jeſus Chriſt: and if ye could read the mind of God in it, ye would reſolve all theſe commands which condemn you and curſe you, into one command of believing in the Son, that ye may be ſaved from that condemnation: And if ye obey this command, which is his laſt command, and moſt perremptory, then are the breaches of all the reſt made up, the intent of all the reſt is fulfilled, though not in your obedience, yet in Chriſts, which is better then ours. Believing in Chriſt preſents God with a perfect righteouſneſs, with an obedience even to the death of the Croſs. When a ſinner hears the holy and ſpiritual ſenſe of the Law, and ſees it in the light of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, O how vile muſt he appear to himſelf, and how muſt he abhor himſelf? What origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pollution, what actual pollution, what a fountain within, what uncleanneſs in ſtreams without will diſcover it ſelf? Now when the moſt part of men get any ſight of this, preſently they fall a waſhing and cleanſing themſelves, or hiding their filthineſs. And what water take they? Their own tears or ſorrows, their own
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:178706:72"/> reſolutions, their own reformations. But alas, we are ſtill more plunged in our own filthineſs, that is ſtill marked before him, becauſe all that is als foul as that we would have waſhen away. What garment do men take to hide themſelves ordinarily? Is it not their own righteouſneſs? Is it not a ſhirt of ſome duty that is ſpread over tranſgreſſions? Do not men think their ſins hid, if they can mourn and pray for a time? Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are eaſed by reflection upon this. But alas, thine iniquity is ſtill marked; Shall fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs hide filthineſs? <hi>Thy righteouſneſs is as a vile garment, as a menſtruous cloth,</hi> Iſa. 64. 6. as well as thine unrighteouſneſs, how then ſhall it cover thy nakedneſs? Seing it is ſo then, what is the Lords mind concerning our cleanſing: ſeing ſtretched out hands, and many prayers will not do it, what ſhall I do? The Lord hath ſhewed thee what thou ſhalt do, and that is, that thou do nothing in relation to that end, that thou ſhouldſt undertake to waſh away the leaſt ſpot by all thy repentance; yet muſt thou waſh and make clean, and the water is brought new unto you, even <hi>the blood of Jeſus Chriſt that cleanſeth from all ſin:</hi> waſh in this blood, and ye ſhall be clean. And what is it to waſh in this blood? It is to believe in Chriſt Jeſus, to lay hold on the all-ſufficient vertue of it, to truſt our ſouls to it, as a ſufficient ranſome for all our ſins; to ſpread the covering of Chriſt his righteouſneſs over all our righteouſneſes and unrighteouſneſs, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both alike need to be hid from his holy eys. Jeſus Chriſt <hi>came by water and by blood.</hi> 1 Jo. 5. 6. by <hi>water</hi> to Sanctifie, and by <hi>blood</hi> to Juſtifie;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:178706:72"/> by the power and cleanſing vertue of the Holy Ghoſt to take away ſin in the beeing of it, and by the vertue of his blood to take away ſin in the guilt and condemnation of it.</p>
               <p>Now I conceive he preſſes a twofold exerciſe upon them in this waſhing, and both have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, to wit, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>faith.</hi> If they be not all one, yet they are in this point inſeparably conjoyned. Repentance waters and ſaps the roots of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which otherwiſe would dry up. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſtead of outward forms and ceremonies of Religion, he preſſeth them to inward ſorrow and contrition of heart for ſin, that they might preſent an acceptable ſacrifice to God, <hi>a contrite heart.</hi> This is more pleaſing then many ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties of men without, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 7 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when I preſs upon you repentance, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that we would have it preparatory to faith, that ye ſhould ſit down and mourn for your ſins for a time, till your hearts be ſo far hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and then ye might come as prepared and fitted to Jeſus Chriſt. This is the miſtake of many Chriſtians, which keeps them from ſolid ſettling. We find it ordinary, ſouls making ſcruples and objections againſt coming to Jeſus Chriſt becauſe of want of ſuch preparations, of meaſures of humiliation and contrition, which they preſcribe to themſelves, or do behold in others: and ſo they ſit down and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuch a work, applyes their conſciences to the Law and curſe; and they find in ſtead of ſoftning, hardneſs, in ſtead of contrition of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, more dulneſs and ſecurity; At leaſt they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:178706:73"/> cannot get ſatisfaction to themſelves in that they ſeek, and thus they hang their head over their impenitent hearts, and lament not ſo much that repentance is not, as that they cannot find it in themſelves. Alas there are many diſeaſes in this one malady. If it were imbowelled unto you, ye would not believe that ſuch a way were ſo contradictory to the Goſpel: For firſt, ye who are ſo, have this principle in your hearts which is the foundation of it. I cannot come to Chriſt ſo unclean, I muſt be a little waſhen, ere I come, the moſt groſs uncleanneſs and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my heart muſt be taken away, and ſo I ſhall be accepted: Alas, what derogation is this to the bleſſed Saviour? What abſurdity is it, <hi>I</hi> am too unclean to come to the fountain, I muſt be a little purged before I come to this fountain that cleanſeth from all Sin. I pray you, why was the fountain opened, was it not for ſin and uncleanneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this thou ſayes by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, If <hi>I</hi> were ſo and ſo humbled, then <hi>I</hi> might come and be worthy to come; when the want of ſuch a meaſure debars thee as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Doth not the having of it in thy eſtimation make the worthy? And ſo ye come with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in your hand to Jeſus Chriſt, with a price and reward to him who gives freely. Again thou denyeſt Chriſt to be the only fountain of all Grace, and ſo it is moſt diſhonourable to him. If thou would have repentance before thou come to him, where ſhall thou have it? will thou find it in thy heart, which is deſperatly wicked? will thou ſeek it of God and not ſeek it in the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt? God out of a Mediator
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:178706:73"/> will not hear thee. In a word there is both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſin, and extream folly in this way: great ſin becauſe it contradicts the tenure of the Goſpel, it diſhonours the Lord Jeſus, the exalted Prince, as if he were not the fountain of all grace, it is contrary both to the freedom of his grace, and to the fulneſs of it alſo. it is great folly, for thou leaves <hi>the living fountain,</hi> and goes ſeeking water in a wilderneſs; thou leaves the Garden, where all herbs grow, and wanders abroad to the wild Mountains; And becauſe thou canſt not find what thou ſeeks, thou ſits down and weeps beſide it. Repentance is in Chriſt, and no repentance ſo pleaſing to God as the mournings and relentings of a pardoned ſinner: but thou ſeeks it far from him, yea, refuſeth him for want of that which thou may have by chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. Therefore we declare this unto you, that whatever ye be, whatever ye want, if ye think ye ſtand in need of Jeſus Chriſt, embrace him: If ye be exceeding vile in your own eyes, and cannot get repentance as ye would, to cleanſe your ſelves, here is the fountain opened, and ready to waſh into. Yet this we muſt tell you, that no ſinner can believe but he that repents, not becauſe repentance is required as a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give a man a warrand and right to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; I know no ground of faith but our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and the Lords promiſe and command unto us, but becauſe no ſoul can truly flie in to Jeſus Chriſt to eſcape ſins guilt, but he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites to be delivered from ſin it ſelf: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt part of you fancy a faith which you have not, becauſe there is no poſſibility
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:178706:74"/> that men will come out of themſelves, till they be preſſed out by diſcovered ſin and miſery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: your woulds and wiſhes after Chriſt and ſalvation, that many of you have, are not the real exerciſes of your ſouls flying unto him for ſalvation. If ye did indeed turn in to Jeſus Chriſt, your hearts would turn the back upon ſin, and theſe ſins ye ſeek remiſſion of. Now all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire that many men have of Chriſt, is this, <hi>I</hi> would fain have his ſalvation, if I might keep my Sin: I would gladly be delivered from the guilt of ſin, if he would let me keep ſtill the ſin. But will Chriſt make any ſuch bargain?</p>

It ſhall be your peace to know it, while it may be amended. But how comes it to paſs that ſo many hearing of the Goſpel, and lying near this fountain, are not cleanſed? <hi>I</hi> think ccrtainly, becauſe they will not have a through cleanſing, they get none at all: All men would love Chriſts blood well to pardon ſin, but who will accept of the water to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them from ſin, but Chriſt came with both. Shall this Blood be ſpent upon numbers of you who have no reſpect to it; but would ſtill wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in your filthineſs?

               <p>THere are two evils in ſin, one is the Nature of it, another the Fruit and ſad Effect of it. In it ſelf it is filthineſs, and contrair to Gods Holineſs, and abaſing of the immortal ſoul, a ſpot in the face of the Lord of the Creatures, that hath far debaſed him under them all: Though it be ſo unnatural to us, yet it is now in our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len eſtate become as it were natural, ſo that men agree with it, as if it were ſunk and drunk into the very ſoul of man. The other is the guilt and deſert of puniſhment and obligation to it. All man hate this, but they cannot hold it off: They eat the Tree and Fruit of Death, they muſt eat Death alſo: They muſt have the wages of ſin, who have wrought for it. Now the Goſpel hath found a remedy for loſt man in Jeſus Chriſt; He comes in the Goſpel with a twofold bleſſing, a twofold vertue, a pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertue and a ſanctifying vertue, <hi>VVater and Blood,</hi> 1 Jo. 5. 6. He comes to forgive ſin, and to ſubdue ſin; To remove the guilt of it, and then the ſelf of it. Gods appointment had inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:178706:76"/> joyned them; And <hi>Chriſt came not to diſſolve the Law, but to eſtabliſh it.</hi> If he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the puniſhment, and left the ſin in its being, he had weakened the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. That conjunction of ſin and wrath, which is both by divine appointment, and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table alſo unto their own natures muſt ſtand, that Divine Juſtice may be intire. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he that comes to redeem us from the curſe of the Law, hath alſo this Commiſſion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem from ſin and all tranſgreſſions of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. He that turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the wrath of God from men, turns alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs from them which provoked his wrath; And ſo he is a compleat Redeemer, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Redeemer he had not been otherwayes. If he had removed Wrath only, and left us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bondage of ſin, it had not been half re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>he that commits ſin, is the ſervant of ſin.</hi> But this is perfect freedom and liberty, to be made free from ſin, for it was ſin that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected us to wrath, and ſo was the firſt Tyrant and the greateſt. The Goſpel then comes with a joyful ſound unto you, but many of you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, and apprehends it to be a Doctrine of Liberty and Peace, and that unto ſin; But if it were ſo, it were no joyful ſound. If there were proclaimed a liberty to all men to do as they liſt, no puniſhment, no wrath to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I would think that Doctrine no glade news, it were but the perpetuating of the bondage of a reaſonable ſoul. But this is glade news, a delivery and freedom proclaimed in the Goſpel, but what? Not unto ſin, but from ſin, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:178706:77"/> this is to be free indeed. We ought more to Jeſus Chriſt for this, then for redemption from Wrath, becauſe ſin is a greater evil then wrath; Yea, wrath were not ſo, if ſin were not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorts to waſh, and waſh ſo, that they may make clean: Take Jeſus Chriſt for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Sanctification, imploy both the Water and the Blood, that he hath come with. But, becauſe all men pretend a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have Chriſt their Saviour, and their ſins pardoned through his Blood, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hate to be reformed, and would ſeek no more of Chriſt: Therefore, he branches out that part of the Exhortation, in ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: All men have a general likeing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, but renouncing of it, is to many a hard Doctrine, they would be glade that God put their evils out of his ſight, by paſſing them by, and forgetting them; But they will not be at the pains of putting away their evils from his ſight: And therefore, the Goſpel which comprehends theſe two united, is not really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by many, who pretend to be followers of it. <hi>This is his Command, that ye believe.</hi> Some pretend to obey this, and yet hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that other part of his Will, even their Sanctification.

                  <hi>Put away the evil,</hi> &amp;c.] When the Spirit convinces a Soul, he convinces a man, not only of evil doings, but of the evil of his doings; Not only of ſin, but of the ſinfulneſs of ſin; And not only of thoſe actions which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſinful, but alſo of the iniquity of Holy things. I think no man will come to waſh in Chriſts Blood, till this be diſcovered. If he ſee much wickedneſs, many evil doings, yet he will labour to waſh away theſe by his own tears and repentance and well doing. As long as he hath any good Actions, as Prayers, Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuch like, he will cover his evil doings by them; He will ſpread the skirts of ſuch righteouſneſs over his uncleanneſſe: and when he hath hid it from his own eyes, he apprehends that he hath hid it from Gods alſo: He will waſh his bloody hands with many Prayers, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:178706:78"/> thinks they may be clean enough: We ſee blaſphemers of Gods Name, uſe to joyn a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for forgiveneſſe with their oath and curſe, and they never trouble themſelves more: Oh what mocking of God is this? Now als long as it is thus, there is no imployment for the Son of Gods Blood, they can do their own turn: Men will not come to Chriſt, becauſe it is the beſt way, if they ſee any elſe beſide. None will come till he ſee it is the only way. None can waſh in Chriſt except they waſh all. If ye have any thing that needs not waſhing, his Blood is not for you: his righteouſneſſe is not known, when ye eſtabliſh all, or a part of your own. I fear the moſt part of you have no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for Chriſt; Ye have extream need of him, but ye know it not; For there are many things which ye will not number among your ſins, your Prayers, your Hearing, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Singing, publick and private Worſhip, giving Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How many of you were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver convinced of any ſin in theſe; Do ye not conceive God is well pleaſed with you for them. Your Conſcience hath convinced you, it may be of groſſe ſins, as drunkenneſſe, filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſwearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ye are not convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for your well doing; Ye find not a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Mediator for theſe: I think many of you never confeſſed any ſuch thing, except in a general notion. Alas, how ignorant are men of themſelves? We are unclean, how can any thing we do cleanſe us? Are not we unclean, and do not our hands touch our own works? Shall not then our own uncleanneſſe defile
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:178706:78"/> our good Actions, more then they can cleanſe us? <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 13. The ignorance of this, makes men go about to build up their old ruined righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and ſtill ſeek ſomething in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to make up wants in themſelves. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, when the Light of God hath diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to your ſelves, ſo that ye can turn your eye no where, but uncleanneſſe fills it, though your Converſation be blameleſſe in the world, ſo as men can challenge nothing, yet ye have found within and without, nothing but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mourning; I ſay, this is an evidence that the Spirit hath ſhined and inlightened thy darkneſſe. Now when thou hath fled unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for a covering to thy righteouſneſſe, als well as unrighteouſneſſe, it remains that thou now <hi>put away the evil of thy doings;</hi> Put not away thy doings, but the evil of them. We challenge your Prayers, Services, and publick Duties, even as the Prophet did; We declare unto you, that God is as evil pleaſed with them, as your drunkenneſſe, whoreing, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The moſt part of you, are no more acceptable when ye come to the Church, then when ye go to the Tavern, your praying and curſing is almoſt all one.

No, ſay I, put not away your Prayers and Ordinances, <hi>but put away the evil of them, from before his ſight.</hi> Rather multiplie your doings, but deſtroy the evil and iniquity of your doings. And there is one evil or two above all, that makes them hateful to him; Ye truſt to much in them: Here is the iniquitie,

                  <hi>ye idol of jealouſie ſet up,</hi> ye make your doings your righteouſneſſe, and in that notion, they are abomination. There is nothing makes your worſhip of God ſo hateful, as this, ye think ſo much of it, and juſtifies your ſelf by it: And then God knows what it is, that ye ſo magnifie, and makes the ground of your claim to Salvation; it is even an empty cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, a ſhadow without ſubſtance; a body without a Soul; You ſpeak and look and hear, you exerciſe ſome outward Senſes, but no inward Affections: And what ſhould that be to him, who is <hi>a Spirit?</hi>

Oh how would men retire within themſelves, to faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Spirits before this All-ſearching, and All-knowing Spirit. If ye do not obſerve the evils of your hearts and ways, they are in his ſight, and this will ſpoil all acceptance of the good of them: If ye obſerve the evils of your well doing, and bring theſe alſo to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to waſh them, and be about this earneſt indeavour of perfecting Holineſſe, of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well-doings in the Power and Fear of God; then certainly, he will not ſet your ſins in the Light of his Countenance, the good of your way ſhall come before him, and the evil of it Chriſt ſhall take away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ceaſe to do evil,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the two Leggs a Chriſtian walks on; if he want any of them, he is lame and cannot go equally, ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from evil, and doing good. Nay, they are ſo united, that the one cannot ſubſiſt without the other. If a man do not ceaſe from evil and his former luſts, he cannot do well, or perfite Holineſs. There are many different Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Conditions of men; There are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally one of two. Some have a kind of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from many groſſe ſins, and are called civil honeſt men, they can abide an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and cenſure of all their Neighbours, they can ſay no ill of them; But alas, there is als little good to be ſaid: He drinks not, ſwears not, whores not, ſteals not. Nay, but what doth he well? Alas, the World cannot tell
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:178706:80"/> what he doth, for he prays not in ſecret, nor in his family, he is void of ſome offences towards men, but there are many duties called to, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards both God and men, he is a ſtranger to. He oppreſſes not the poor, nay, but he is not charitable either, to give to them; He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauds no man, but whom helps he by his means? Again, there are others, they will boaſt of ſome things done; they pray, they keep the Church well, they do many good turns, and yet for all that, they do not ceaſe to do evil; They were drunkards, ſo they are; They can ſwear for all their prayers, are given to contention, to lying, to filthineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I ſay, neither of theſe Religions is pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled. Religion is a through and intire change; It is like a new Creation, that muſt deſtroy the firſt Subject, to get place for that which is to come; It is a putting off old Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to put one new; The putting off an old form and engraven Image, to make place for a new engraving. Men do not put a Seal above a Seal, but deface the old, and ſo put on the new; Men do not put new Cloaths upon the old, but put the old off, and ſo they have place for the new: Religion muſt have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man; Godlineſſe is a new Suit, that will not go on upon ſo many Luſts; No, no, it is more meet and more conformed unto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the Soul then ſo: The cold muſt go out as the heat comes in: Many men do not change their Garments, but mends them, puts ſome new pieces into them; They retain their old luſts, their heart idols, and they will add
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:178706:80"/> unto theſe a patch of ſome External Obedience; But alas, is this godlineſſe? Hypocriſie will be content of a mixture, ſin is the harlot, whoſe heart could endure to ſee the Child parted, It can give God a part, to get leave to brook the moſt part; Sin will give God liberty to take ſome of the outward man, if it keep the heart and ſoul. But God will not reckon on theſe terms, he will have all the man or nothing, for he is the Righteous Owner. True godlineſſe cannot mix ſo, but falſe and counterfeit may do it well. Other men again, poſſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths themſelves of ſome practices, but they put on no new cloathing; They reform ſome paſſages for fear of cenſure, or ſhame, or ſuch like; They are found, it may be, blameleſſe, either becauſe ſo Educated, or their Diſpoſition is againſt particular groſſe ſins. But they are not cloathed upon with Holineſſe and well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo they are but naked and bare in Gods ſight, not beautiful; They have ſweept their houſe, and ſome Devil put out or kept out, but becauſe the good Spirit enters not, ordinarily ſeven worſe enter again into-ſuch men.</p>
               <p>There is a great moment of perſwaſion in this order of the Exhortation, <hi>Waſh you,</hi> and then, <hi>put away the evil of your doings,</hi> and <hi>ceaſe to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> Do not continue in your former cuſtoms. It is ſtrange, how contrary our hearts are to God; We uſe to turn Grace unto wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; We uſe to take more liberty to ſin, when we conceive we are pardoned: But <hi>I</hi> do not know any more ſtrong and conſtraining per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion

Oh what an inducement and grand Argument, to renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of evils, is the conſideration of the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.

I pray you conſider, if you be Chriſtians indeed, give a proof of it. What hath Jeſus Chriſt done for you? He hath given himſelf, his own precious Blood a Ranſom for us, will ye not give up your ſelves to him? Will not ye give him your ſins and luſts, which are not your ſelf, but enemies to your ſelf? Will not ye put away theſe ills, that he came in this world to deſtroy? Art thou a Chriſtian, and are there yet ſo many ſins, and works of the Devil raigning in thee, and ſet up in Gods ſight?

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:178706:81"/> Give them a bill of divorcement, never to turn again. Many a man parts with his ſin, becauſe it leaves him, he puts it not away; Temptation goes, and occaſion goes away, but the root of it abids within him. Many men have particular jarrs with their corruptions, but they reconcile again, as differences between married perſons; They do not ariſe to hate their ſin in its ſinful Nature. But if thou hate, it then put it away. And who would not hate it, that Chriſt ſo hated, that he came to deſtroy it? 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 5. What a great indignity muſt it be to the Goſpel, to make that the ground of living in ſin, which is preſſed in it, as the grand perſwaſion to forſake it? Seing we are waſhed from the guilt of it, Oh let us not love to keep the ſtain and filth of it. Why are we waſhen? Was it not Chriſts great intendment and purpoſe, to purifie to himſelf a Holy People? We are waſhen from the guilt of our ſins, and is it to defile again? Is it not rather <hi>to keep our ſelves henceforth clean, that we may be preſented holy and unblameable in his ſight?</hi> That we may ſeek to be als like Heaven as may be, But who ceaſes to do theſe evils, that he ſays are pardoned? Who puts away the evils of theſe doings, the guilt whereof, he thinks God hath put away? Could ye find in your hearts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thoſe evils ſo familiarly, to pour out your Souls unto them, if that Peace of God were indeed ſpoken unto you? Would not he reflex of his Love prove more conſtraining on your hears? Were it poſſible, that if ye did indeed conſider, that your luſts coſt Chriſt a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:178706:82"/> dear price, to ſhed his Blood, that your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures made his Soul heavy to death, and that he hath laid down his Life to Ranſom you from Hell; were it poſſible, I ſay, that ye would live ſtill in theſe luſts, and chooſe theſe pleaſurs of ſin, which were ſo bitter to our Lord Jeſus? I beſeech you be not deceived, if ye love the puddle ſtill, that ye cannot live out of it, do not ſay that ye are waſhed? Ye may have waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your ſelves with Sope and Nitre, but the Blood of Chriſt hath not cleanſed: For if that Blood ſprinkled your Conſcience once, to give you an anſwer to all challenges, it could not but ſend forth Streams to purifie the heart, and ſo the whole man. The Blood and VVater might be joyned, the Juſtifying Saviour, and the Sanctifying Spirit; For both theſe are in this Goſpel waſhing. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. 1 <hi>Jo</hi> 5. 6. <hi>This is be that came by water and blood, even Jeſus Chriſt, not by water only, but by water and blood.</hi> Not by water only, but by blood alſo, and I ſay, not by blood only, but by water alſo. The very purpoſe of forgiveneſſe, is not to lay a foundation for more ſin, but that men may ſin no more, but break off their ſins. It is indeed impoſſible for a man to amend his ways, till he be pardoned, for his ſin ſtands betwixt him and God, God is a conſuming fire, the guilt of it hinders all meeting of the Soul with God, at leaſt, all influence from him; But when an open Door is made in Chriſt, that men may come and Treat with God, notwithſtanding of rebellions, and have the Curſe relaxed: O now he may go about his Duty comfortably.

                  </gap> given for the asking. There are ſome Ceſſations from ſin, that are not real forſakings of it, and ceaſings from it: You know men will abſtain from Eating for a ſeaſon, that they may be made ripe for it another time: Some do not ceaſe from ſin, but delayes it only, they put it not away, but put it off only for another time, till a fitter occaſion and opportunity. And this is ſo far from ceaſing from it, that it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an deliberat choice of it, and Election of conveniency for it: There may be ſome pure and ſimple ceaſings from ſin, meer abſtinence, or rather meer abſence of ſin for a ſeaſon, that is not ceaſing from doing evil. The Chriſtians ceaſing hath much Action in it: It is ſuch a ceaſing from doing evil, that it is a putting away of evil; It hath the Soul and Spirit joyned in that Ceſſation. Sin requires violence to put it out, where it hath haunted, it is an intruding Gueſt, and an uſurping Gueſt: It comes in firſt as a ſupplicant and beggar, prays for a little lodging for a night, and promiſes to be gone, the temptation ſpeaks but for a little time, even the preſent time, for a little one, it ſeeks but litle at firſt, leaſt it be denyed; but if once it be received into the Soul, it preſently becomes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and can command its own time, and its abode: Then ye will not ſo eaſily put it out, as ye could hold it out, for it is now joyned with that wicked, deſperat party within you, <hi>the heart,</hi> and theſe united Forces are too ſtrong for you. According as a luſt is one with a mans
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:178706:83"/> heart, or hath nearer connexion with his heart and Soul, it is the worſe to put away: for will ye drive a man from himſelf, it is the cuting off an right hand, or plucking out of an right eye. To make a man ceaſe from ſuch evils, it requirs that a ſtronger power be within him, then is in the world. Men may ceaſe for a time, for want of occaſions or temptations to ſin; when there is no active principle in them, reſtraining or keeping their Soul from ſuch ſins as appears af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when no ſonner occaſion is offered, but they run as the Horſe to his courſe, or the Stone fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth downward, they conceive Fire as eaſily as dry Stubble: That is not Chriſtian ceaſing, which is that which the Soul argues it ſelf to, from grounds of the Goſpel. Should I who am dead to ſin, live any longer therein? This is a principle of Ceſſation, and this is true liberty, when the Soul can abſtain from preſent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon ſuch grounds and perſwaſions of the Goſpel, then it is really above it ſelf, and above the world, then hath it that true victory. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men ceaſe only from ſin, becauſe ſin ceaſes from them, they have not left it, but it hath left them. The old man thinks himſelf a changed man, becauſe he wallows not in the luſts of the fleſh, as in his youth. But alas, no thanks to him, for that he hath not ceaſed from his luſts: but temptations to him, or power and ability in him to follow them hath ceaſed, there is no change in his Spirit within, for he can talk of his former ſins with pleaſure, he continues in other evils as bad, but more ſuitable to his age. In a word, he is ſo inwardly, that if he were in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:178706:83"/> his body, and occaſions offering as before, he would be juſt the ſame. Some again ceaſe from ſome evils, from ſome principles, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, they are no Chriſtian principles: VVhat reſtrains the multitude of Civilians from groſſe ſcandals? Is it any thing but affectation of a good Name and report in the world? Is it not fear of reproach or cenſure? Is it not becauſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they have no particular inclination to ſueh evils? And yet there are many other evils of the heart als evil, though more ſubtill, that they pleaſe themſelves in, as Pride, Covetouſneſſe, Malice, Envie, Ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> VVhat ſhall all your abſtinence be accompted of, when it is not love to Jeſus Chriſt, or hatred of ſin that principles it? It is not the outward abſtinence that will commend you. Such it is, as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of it are. And theſe only are the true Chriſtian principles of Mortification, love of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>which conſtrains men to live no more to themſelves,</hi> but to be new Creatures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15.

               <p>ALL men love to have priviledges above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Every one is upon the deſigne and ſearch after ſome well-being, ſince <hi>Adam</hi> loſt that which was true happineſſe: We all agree upon the general notion of it, but preſently men divide in the following of particulars. Here all men united in ſeeking after ſome good, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſatisfie their Souls, and ſatiat their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Nay, but they ſcatter preſently in the proſecution of it, becauſe, according to every mans fancy and corrupt humour, they attribute that good unto diverſe things; And when they meet with diſappointment, they change their opinion of that, but are made no wiſer, for they turn from one to another of that ſame kind, in which their imagination hath ſuppoſed bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be: And therefore, they will return to that which they firſt loathed and rejected. Is there then no ſuch thing in the world as bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Is it not to be found among men? Are all mens unſatiable deſires in vain? Is a Creature made up and compoſed of deſires, to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:178706:85"/> keep it in continuall torment and vexation of ſpirit? No certainly, it is, and it is found by ſome; All the world ſtrive about it, but the man only who truſts and believs in God, he it is who carries it away from them, who hath this priviledge beyond the world. And why do ſo many miſſe it? Becauſe they do not ſee nor ſuſpect that it is bleſſedneſſe indeed which he injoyes: But on the contrair, their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted imaginations repreſent godlineſſe, and a godly mans ſelf-indigency and dependance on God, as the greateſt miſery and ſhame. The godly man hids not his bleſſedneſſe from the world. No, he proclaimes it when he hath found it; He would that all enjoyed it with him. And if there were no more to declare, that it doth not conſiſt in worldly things, this might ſuffice; they are not communicable to many, without the prejudice and loſſe of every one. But none will believe his report, of his own Eſtate.</p>
               <p>If ye would conſider, here is that which men toyl for, compaſſe Sea and Land for, here it is, <hi>near thee, in thy mouth:</hi> It is not in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that thou ſhould ſay, <hi>How ſhall I aſcend to it?</hi> It is not in Hell below, that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſay, <hi>Who ſhall deſcend?</hi> It is not in the ends of the Earth; No, <hi>it is near thee, in thy mouth:</hi> It is not beyond the Sea, <hi>but it is near, in thy mouth, even the word of faith,</hi> which Chriſt preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. And what ſayes that word? <hi>Believe with thy heart and thou ſhalt be ſaved; Truſt in God and depend on him, and ye ſhall have peace,</hi> and that perfect peace: and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:178706:86"/> this peace ſhall be kept by God himſelf. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then is the man that truſts in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 40. 4. Ye make a long journey in vain, ye ſpend your Labour and Money in vain, all the pains might be ſaved, it is not where ye ſeek it; ye travel about many creatures, ye go to many doors, and enquire for Happineſſe and Peace, but ye go too far off, ye need not ſearch ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Coaſts, it is nearer hand, in this word of the Goſpel, the joyful ſound; It is this that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes peace. Peace is a comprehenſive word, eſpecially in Scripture. It was the Jews ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Peace be to you,</hi> meaning happineſſe and all good things: It is Chriſts ſalutation, Grace and Peace. Grace is Holineſſe, Peace is Happineſſe, and theſe are either one, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably conjoyned as one. This was the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Song, <hi>Glory to God, peace on earth,</hi> Luk. 2. 14. Bleſledneſſe was reſtored, or brought near to be reſtored, to miſerable man by Jeſus Chriſt, and upon the apprehenſion of this, Angels Sing. It was this, Chriſt came in the world with, and when he went away, he left this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy to his Children, <hi>My peace I leave you,</hi> Jo. 14 27. We loſt happineſſe, and all men are on a vain purſuit of it ſince, but it is found, and found by one of our Kin, our Lord Jeſus, our Elder Brother, he hath found it, or made it, and brought it near us in the Goſpel, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and who ſo receives him by Faith, and truſting in him, receives that priviledge, that peace. He endured much trouble to gain our peace, he behoved to undergo miſery,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:178706:86"/> to purchaſe our Bleſſedneſſe, and ſo it is his own, and who ſo receives him, receives it alſo.</p>
               <p>The newes of ſuch a peace might be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the time of warr and trouble, if we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended our need of it. It is not a peace from warr and trouble, but a peace in warr and trouble. <hi>My peace I leave you, in the world ye ſhall have trouble,</hi> Jo. 14. 27. and 16. at the end. What a bleſſed Meſſage is it, that there is a peace, and a perfect peace, attainable in the midſt of warrs, confuſions and calamities of the times publick and perſonal, a perfect peace, a compleat peace, even compleat without the acceſſion of outward and worldly peace, that needs it not, nay, appears moſt perfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire in it ſelf, when it is ſtriped naked of them all. Behold what a priviledge the Goſpel of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers unto you; Ye need not be made miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable but if you pleaſe. This is more then all the world can afford you, there is no man can promiſe to himſelf immunity from publick dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or perſonal, from many griefs and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments: But the Goſpel bids you reckon up all your troubles and miſeries that ye can meet with in the world, and yet in ſuch a caſe, if ye hearken to wiſdom, there is a peace that will make you forget that trouble; <hi>Her wayes are wayes of pleaſantneſs, and all her pathes are peace,</hi> Pro. 3. 17. I will undertake to make thee bleſſed, ſays <hi>Wiſdom, the Fathers Wiſdom.</hi> When all the world hath given thee over for miſerable, when thou haſt ſpent thy ſubſtance on the Phyſicians, and in vain, come to me, I
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:178706:87"/> can heal that deſperate Diſeaſe by a word, I <hi>create peace,</hi> when natural Cauſes have given it over, I create it of nothing, <hi>I will keep you in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace.</hi>

The poor beaten ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner caſts an Anchor within the Vail, on that ſure ground of immutable Promiſes in Jeſus Chriſt. And then it reſts and quiets it ſelf at that Anchor, enjoyes peace in the midſt of the ſtorm, there is a great calm, it is not moved, or not greatly moved, as if it were a fair day: <hi>David</hi> flieth unto God as his refuge, Anchor's upon the Name of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 1, 2. And ſo he enjoys a perfect calm and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>I ſhall not be moved,</hi> becauſe he is united to the Rock, he is tyed to the firm Foundation Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and no ſtorm can diſſolve this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not becauſe of the ſtrength of that Rope of Faith, it is but a weak Cord, if Omnipotency did not compaſſe it about alſo: And ſo <hi>we are kept by the power of God, through faith unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> The poor wearied Traveller, the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime ſits down under the ſhadow of a Rock, and this peace is his reſt under it. Faith lays him down, and peace is his reſt and ſleep. Faith in Jeſus Chriſt is a motion towards him, as the ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now Hope is the Conjunction or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul with him, the Soul then ſtaying and reſting on him, as in its proper place; And ſo it enjoys perfect peace and reſt in its place:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:178706:88"/> ſo that if ye remove it thence, then ye offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to it.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things are of greateſt importance to you to know: What this perfect Peace is, and what is the way to attain it? The one is the Priviledge and Dignity, the other is the Duty of a Chriſtian, and theſe two make him up what he is.</p>
               <p>I would think that man perfectly bleſſed, who is at peace with two things, God and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If a man be at peace with Creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, and be not at peace with himſelf, but have warr within his own Mind, that mans Peace is no Peace, let be perfect peace. <hi>A mans greateſt enemy is within his own houſe.</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in indeed, when it is in his boſome and ſoul; When a mans Conſcience is againſt him, it is worſe then a world beſide. <hi>Conſcientia mille teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> ſo, <hi>I</hi> ſay, it is <hi>mille hoſtes.</hi> It is a thouſand witneſſes, and a thouſand enemies.

And there is reaſon for it, for there is none to bear it: A ſound and whole Spirit can ſuſtain infirmities, but when that is wounded, which ſhould bear all the reſt, what is behind to bear it? It is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to it ſelf: If a man have trouble and warr in this world, yet there is often eſcaping from it; A man may fly from his enemy, but when thy enemy is within thee, whither ſhall thou fly?

But if he be at peace with God and himſelf, I know not what he wants of the perfect peace, of the <hi>Peace, Peace:</hi> For it is a mans Mind that makes peace or warr, it is not outward things; but in the midſt of peace, he may be in trouble, and in the midſt of trouble, in peace, according as he hath ſatisfaction and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his own breaſt: For what is all the Grace of a Chriſtian? It is Godlineſſe with Contentment: It is not Godlineſs and Riches, Godlineſs and Honour, or Pleaſure, Godlineſs and outward Peace. No, no, Contentment compenſeth all theſe, and hath in it eminently, all the gain and advantage of theſe. A man in Honour, a Rich man, having no contentment in it, is really als poor, als ignominious, as the poor and deſpiſed man. If Contentment then be without theſe things, certainly they cannot be miſſed; For where Contentment is not with them, it only is miſſed, and they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Contentment is all the Gain that men ſeek in Riches and Honour and Pleaſure; If a Godly man have that ſame without them, he then hath all the Gain and Advantage, and wants nothing, but ſome trouble that ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attends them: Outward Peace cannot add to inward peace, and ſo the want of it, cannot diminiſh.</p>
               <p>We muſt begin at the Original, if we would know rightly this peace that paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The Fountain head is peace with God; a ſtream of this, is peace of Conſcience,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:178706:90"/> and peace with the Creatures.

Now there is no more making up this peace on ſuch termes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: We have no capacity to treat with God any more. But bleſſed be his Majeſty, who hath found out the way of Agreement and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. Oh that ye were once perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of your enimity againſt God: Ye are not born friends, though ye be born within the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church. How dreadful a thing is it, to have the moſt High and Terrible God againſt you, to do to you according to your deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Ye all know this, we are enemies to God by Nature, I pray you, is it but a name? Is it not worthy deep conſideration? But who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth this matter? If ye loſs a friend, ye will be troubled, and the more behoveful your friend was, the more troubled you will be. If a great and potent Nation proclaimed Warr againſt us, we cannot but be ſenſible of it: But alas, who conſidereth the great breach that is between God and all Men, occaſioned by the firſt mans tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and rebellion. It is one of the degrees of health, to know the diſeaſe, and I may call it a degree of peace, a kind of preparation to peace, to know the enimity, and not generally to know it, but to ponder it till the heart be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it; To call a Council of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Affections of the Soul, to conſider the great imminent danger of mans common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. What is it, I pray you, that is the greateſt obſtruction of mens making peace with God, that makes the breach irreparable, and the wound incurable? It is this, certainly;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:178706:91"/> No man apprehendeth it aright; We intertain good thoughts of our friendſhip with God, or that it is eaſy to be reconciled.

Is not every man offering God ſatisfaction, either his Tears, or ſorrow, or amendment in time coming, or all of them? Do not men undertake to pacify God with External Ordinances, and think it may ſuffice for their ſins? Certainly ye are ignorant, of the infinite ſeparation between God and man, that imagines a Treaty with him your ſelf, or that ever ye can come in ſpeaking termes. And therefore is this Warr and Enimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perpetual; therefore, there is no peace, when ye cry peace, peace. When ye have peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, and ſay that ye have peace with God; Yet certainly, <hi>the Lord thy God is againſt thee, and will not ſpare thee,</hi> Deut. 29. 19. Many of you bleſſe your ſelves in your own hearts; when ye hear the Curſe and Threatning of the Law, ye ſay, God forbid, or all that were true. Well, thus ſaith the Lord, all theſe Curſes that are written in this book, ſhall ly upon thee, and the Lord ſhall ſeparate thee unto evil, becauſe ye take not with your enimity, there can be no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Mediator can have no imployment from you:</p>
               <p>How ſhall the breach of peace be made up? Since the firſt Covenant cannot be made up again where ſhall the remedy be found? God is juſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:178706:91"/> and righteous, Men are rebellious and ſinful; Can theſe meet, and the one not be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Will not God be a conſuming Fire, and men as Stubble before the Lords preſence? Therefore, there muſt be a Mediator between them, a Peace-maker, to make of two, one, to take up the difference. And this Mediator muſt be like both, and yet neither wholly the one, nor the other. He muſt therefore be God and Man, that he may be a fit Days man, betwixt God and man. And this is our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In his Divinity, he comes near to God, in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity he comes near to man; In his Perſon, he is between both, and he is fit to make peace; And therefore, he is <hi>a Prince of Peace,</hi> Iſa, 9. 6. And that he may be a Prince of Peace, he muſt be both <hi>An Everlaſting Father</hi> like God, and a young Child like unto man: God to prevail with God, and a man to engage for man; And therefore he is called <hi>our Peace,</hi> Eph. 2. 14. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt enters in a Covenant with the Father, wherein he undertakes to bear our Curſe, and the chaſtiſement of our Peace; he is content to be dealt with as the Rebel, <hi>upon me, upon me be the iniquity,</hi> and ſo there comes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, as it were; of that bleſſed peace he had with the Father, he is content that there ſhould be a Covering of Wrath, ſpread over the Fathers Love, that he ſhould handle the Son as an Enemy; And therefore it is, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are admitted as Friends, his Obedience takes away our Rebellion; The Cloud of the Lords Diſpleaſure powers down upon him, that it might be fair weather to us: The Armies
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:178706:92"/> of Curſes that were againſt us, Encounter him, and he by being overcome, overcometh; By being ſlain by Juſtice, Satan and Sin, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh all thoſe, <hi>and killeth the enmity on the croſs, making peace by his Blood,</hi> Col. 2. 14, 15. Eph. 2 15. And it is this Sacrifice that hath pacified Heaven, the ſweet ſmell of it hath gone above, and made peace in the High places.</p>
               <p>Here then is the priviledge of a Believer, to be at peace with God, to be one with him: And this indeed is Life Eternal, to be united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fountain of Life, in whoſe favour is Life, and whoſe loving kindneſſe is better then Life: Is not this a bleſſed Eſtate? Whatever a man hath done againſt God, it is all forgiven and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, ſhall never come in remembrance. Are not Angels bleſſed who are friends with God? Such is the Soul whoſe ſins are pardoned through Chriſt, their ſins are as if they never had been; The Soul is not only eſcaped that terrible wrath of God, but being at peace with God, all the goodneſſe that is communicable to Creatures, it ſhall partake of. <hi>That they may be one, as we are one, that they may be perfect in one,</hi> Joh. 17. This Chriſt prayed for, and this was the end of his Death, to make of two, one; So then, the Glory that Chriſt is partaker of with the Father, we muſt be partakers of with him, and all this, by vertue of that peace with God by him. Oh if ye knew what enimity with God is, how would it indear and make preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous peace with him? The one engageth all that is in God, to be againſt a man: the other
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:178706:92"/> engageth all that is in him, to be for a man. And is not he then a great One, whither he be a Friend or an Enemy? Is he not the beſt Friend and worſt Enemy? Who hath moſt power, yea, all power to employ for whom he will, and againſt whom he will. What a bleſſed change is it, to have God, of a conſuming Fire, made a Sun, with Healing and Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? That the Righteous, Holy and Juſt God, before whom, no fleſh can ſtand, ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo rebellious ſinners, and dwell among them. He had not only power to deſtroy, but Law againſt us alſo: What a perfect peace is it then, that the Judge becometh a merciful Father, and the Law of Ordinances is cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that power imployed to keep Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, and us to Salvation. Ye who have made Peace and Atonement through Chriſts Blood, rejoyce in the Hope of the Glory of God; There wants nothing to make you compleatly bleſſed, but the clear and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſight, and knowledge of your Eſtate before God.</p>
               <p>Now when this peace, which is made up in Heaven is intimated unto the Conſcience, then all the Tempeſts and Clouds of it evaniſh, and this is the peace of believing, which is the Souls reſting and quieting it ſelf upon the believed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God. There may be a great Calm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, <hi>goodwill in God tomards men,</hi> and yet great Tempeſts in this lower Region, <hi>no peace on earth.</hi> There is a peace of Conſcience, which is a diſeaſe of Conſcience, a benumed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Conſcience, or a ſleep of Conſcience,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:178706:93"/> when men walk in the imagination of their own hearts, and flatter themſelves in their own eyes, will not trouble themſelves with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the wrath of God, when Souls will not ſuffer their ſin, or the curſe to enter in. This is that <hi>no peace,</hi> which the Lord ſpeaks often of, it is but a dream, and when a man awaketh, alas, what a dreadful ſight meets he with firſt, <hi>ſudden deſtruction;</hi> Sin enters in the Conſcience, and the Law, the ſtrength of ſin, and ſo that peace endeth in an eternal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe. But what is the reaſon, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of Gods Juſtice and mens Sins, ſo many are not affraid of him, ſo many paſſe the time, without fear of Wrath and Hell? Is it not becauſe they have taken hold of his Strength and made peace with him? No indeed, but becauſe they know not the power of his Anger, to fear him according to his Wrath: Who will ſpend one hour in the examination of his own ways, in ſearching out ſins, in counting his debt, till he find it paſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? No, men intertain the thoughts of ſin, and hell and wrath, as if it were coals in their boſom, they ſhake them out, they like and love any diverſion from them. Oh, ignorance maketh much peace, I would ſay, ſecurity, which is ſo much worſe then fear, becauſe it is ſo far from the remedy, that it knoweth not the evil and danger. It is not the riſing of the Sun of Righteouſneſſe, ſhining into the Soul, that hath cleared them: but their perpetual darkneſſe that blindeth them. I ſay then, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, that ye never knew
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:178706:93"/> the peace of God, who knew not warr with God: Ye know not love, who have not known anger. But this is the Souls true peace and tranquillity, when it is once awakened to ſee its miſery and danger; How many Clouds overſpread it, what Tempeſts blow, what Waves of Diſpleaſure go over its head? But when that peace, which is made in the High Places, breaketh thorow the Cloud with a Voice, <hi>Son, be of good comfort, thy ſins be forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thee,</hi> when that Voice of the Spirit is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, preſently at its command the Wind and Waves obey; the Soul is calmed as the Sea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Storm; It is not only untroubled, but it is peaceable upon ſolid grounds, becauſe of the word which ſpeaks peace in Chriſt. The peace of the moſt of you, is ſuch as ye were born and Educated withal: It is not a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted peace, a ſpoken peace, the fruit of the lips, and ſo no true peace.

When a Soul hath put to its Seal by believing Gods word, and hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Gods Truth and Faithfulneſſe in his word, the Spirit Sealeth mutually the Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Faith, both by more Holineſſe, and the knowledge of it. And how great peace is this, when a Soul can look upon all its iniquities, when they compaſſe about a man, and outward trouble ſharpeneth and ſetteth on edge inward challenges, and yet the Soul will not fear, it hath anſwers to them all in Chriſts Blood, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 5. This is a greater word then all the world can ſay. Many mens fearleſneſſe proceedeth from ignorance of ſin, their iniquities were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſet in order before them, but if once they compaſſed them about, and wrath like a fiery wall compaſſe them about alſo, ſo that there were no eſcaping: Oh it would be more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, then all the Armies of the world; Ye would account little of a Kingdom, ye would exchange it for ſuch a word as <hi>David</hi> hath upon good grounds.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay again, the Soul that hath thus committed it ſelf to him as a faithful keeper, may have peace in all Eſtates and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And this peace floweth from that other peace. There is a peace which guards the heart and mind, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6, 7.

The Soul of a Believer, may be in an equal even Tenur and Diſpoſition in all conditions; It may poſſeſſe it ſelf in patience; Impatience
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:178706:94"/> and Anxiety, makes a man not his own man, he is not himſelf, he injoys not himſelf, he is a burden to himſelf, and is his own tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But if Souls were ſtayed upon God, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they would poſſeſſe themſelves, dwell ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely within their own breaſts. We may find that the moſt part of men, are expoſed to all the floods and waves of the times: They move inwardly, as things are troubled outwardly: Every thing addeth moment to their grief, or joy: Any Diſpenſation caſteth the Ballance, and either weights them down with diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, or lifteth them up with vanity and lightneſſe of mind. But the Believers privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to be unmoved in the midſt of all the Toſſings and Confuſions of the times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128. 1, 2. Ye would <hi>be as Mount Zion, if ye truſted in God;</hi> No Diſpenſation ſhould enter into the Soul, to caſt the Ballance upon you; Ye might ſtand upon your Rock Jeſus Chriſt, and look about the Eſtates, Perſons, Affairs and Minds of men, as a troubled Sea, fleeting, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up and down, and ye ſtand <hi>and not be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or not greatly moved,</hi> Pſ. 62. 2. And this is to be wiſe indeed.

He needeth not be diſquieted, or troubled after, becauſe it ſhall turn about to his good; <hi>All things ſhall do ſo,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. He needeth not be Anxious about future Events, becauſe he hath all his burden caſt upon another, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſupplication; VVhat needeth he then take a needleſſe burden? Prayer will do that, which Care pretends and cannot do, and that without trouble. He needeth not be troubled when things are preſent, for he cannot by his thought, either add or diminiſh, take away or prevent. There is one good and neceſſary thing, that his heart is upon, and that cannot
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:178706:95"/> be taken from him; And therefore, all things elſe are indifferent, and of ſmall concernment to him.</p>
               <p>Now what wanteth ſuch a man of perfect peace, who is reconciled to God, and at peace within himſelf? VVhen peace guardeth the Heart and Mind within, compaſſeth it as a Caſtle or Gariſon, to hold out all the vain A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms of External things. May not all the world be troubled about him; VVhat though the Floods lift up their Voice, if they come not into the Soul? If he be one and the ſame in Peace and Trouble, Proſperity and Adverſity, do not lament him in the one more then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is the Mind that maketh your Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion good or bad. But yet, I ſay, the Beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath likewiſe peace with all the Creatures, which the world hath not, and even in this he is a priviledged man. <hi>He is in league with the ſtones of the field, and in peace in his tabernacle,</hi> Job. 5. 23. <hi>All things are his, becauſe he is Chriſts, and all are Chriſts,</hi> who is the poſſeſſor of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, at leaſt the Righteous Heir of both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21. The Unbeliever hath no right to the Creature; Though there be a Ceſſation for a time, between them and him, yet that is no peace, for they will at length be armed againſt him, they are witneſſes already againſt him, and groan to God for the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that mans ſin hath ſubjected them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. His Table is, it may be, full, yet it is a ſnare unto him: He getteth eaſe and quietneſſe outwardly: Nay, but it ſlayeth the fool
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:178706:96"/> and deſtroyeth him. But the godly man is at peace thorow Chriſts Blood, with all Croſſes and Comforts; The Sting and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of all evils is taken away by Chriſt.

                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:178706:97"/> is not better then warr: Some neceſſary warr is better, then evil grounded peace. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes have been long in pain, labouring to bring forth a ſafe and well-grounded peace. But alas, we have been in pain and brought forth wind, when we looked for peace, no good came; and for healing, behold trouble. But how ſhall we arrive at our deſired Haven? Certainly, if peace be well grounded, it muſt have Truth for its Foundation, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for its Companion; <hi>Truth muſt ſpring out of the earth, and righteouſneſs look down from heaven.</hi> This were the compendious way for publick peace, if every man would make his own peace with God: There are controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with God, between King, Nobles and People, and therefore, God Fomenteth the warrs in the Kingdoms; If you would have theſe ended, make peace with God in Chriſt, by flying in unto him, and reſting on him; more truſting in God would diſpatch our warrs; Truſting in the arm of fleſh continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. Allways what ever be, peace or warr, here is the buſineſſe that more concerns you, your eternal peace and ſafty; And if ye were more careful of this, to ſave your own Souls, you would help the publick more. If you could be once perſwaded to be Chriſtians indeed, we needed not preſſe many duties in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the publick, and untill you be once perſwaded to ſave your ſelves, by flying from the wrath to come, it is in vain to ſpeak of pub,lick Duties to you. We do therefore, declare unto you the way of obtaining perfect peace,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:178706:98"/> peace as a River, if you will quite all ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences, fly from your ſelves as your greateſt enemies, and truſt your Souls unto the Promiſe in Jeſus Chriſt, and lean all your weight on him, we aſſure you, your peace ſhall run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly and perpetually. Whoever truſteth in Creatures, in uncertain Riches, in worldly peace, in whatſoever thing, beſide the only liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and glorious Lord, we perſwade him, that his peace ſhall fail as a Brook: All things in this world ſhall deal deceitfully with you, as a Brook which is blackiſh, by reaſon of Ice, what time it waxeth warm, it ſhall evaniſh; you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant is ſaid to truſt, that he can drink out a River, but he is deceived, for he may drink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it runs, and ſhall run for ever. If any thing would eſſay to take your peace from you, it is a vain attempt, for it runs like a River; it may be ſhallower and deeper, but it cannot run dry, becauſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Are your hearts asking within you, how ſhall this peace be attained? If you deſire to

               <p>Truſting in God, is the leaning of the Souls weight on God, the Soul hath a burden above it, heavy and unſupportable, and this the truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er caſteth upon God; And ſo <hi>he is a loadened and weary man, whom Chriſt exhorteth to come to him, and he ſhall find eaſe for his Soul,</hi> Matth. 11. 28.

               <p>There are two particulars which I conceive the truſting Soul is ſtayed on, Firſt, in the meditation of God, Secondly, in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from him of all good things. When I ſay the Meditation of God. <hi>I</hi> take in both Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and Affection. The moſt part of men have but few thoughts of God at all, even thoſe who truſt in him, do not conſider ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, what a One he is in whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. If Faith were vigorous and lively, it would put men to often thinking on him, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know him in his glorious Names, the mind would be ſtayed upon this glorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as the moſt Myſterious and Wonderful One. How throng are mens minds with their vanities? <hi>When they awake, they are not ſtill with God;</hi> The Meditation of him is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to them; Any other thing geteth more time and thoughts. But Meditation addeth Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Contemplation; Men may think long upon the Heavens and their Courſe, but their Affections are not raviſhed with them: But this is the Soul ſtayed on God, when the Souls deſires are towards the remembrance of his Name, then Affection ſtayeth the mind u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon what it pitcheth one: And certainly,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:178706:101"/> the mind giveth but paſſing looks, conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoughts where the heart is not: Here is <hi>Davids</hi> Meditation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>My delight is in the law of the Lord.</hi> The Soul of a Believer ſhould be conſtant and fixed in the conſideration of God, till he be wholly ingaged to admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and wondering. <hi>O Lord how excellent is thy Name,</hi> Pſ. 8. 1. <hi>And who is like unto thee?</hi> You all ſay that you believe in God, and know his Power, you know he is Good, he is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, Juſt, Long ſuffering, Faithful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what is all this knowledge but ignorance, and your light darkneſs, when it doth not preſs you to put your truſt in his Name? You know; Nay, but you conſider not what you know: This is truſting, when the mind is ſtayed on what it knoweth, when all the ſcattered thoughts and affections are called home, and united in one, to be exerciſed about this comprehenſive Object, <hi>The Lord our God.</hi> It is not want of knowledge deſtroyeth you, but want of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what you know, and this is brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Mens hearts do not carry Seal and Stamp of their knowledge, becauſe thoughts of God and his word are but as paſſengers that go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Land, as lightning going thorow the mind, but warms it not: And ſo their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice carrieth no impreſſion of it either. How baſe is it for thoſe who have God for their God, to be ſo ignorant of him. Would not any man willingly travel about his own poſſeſſions Have you ſuch a large portion Believers, and ſhould you be taken up with other vanities? Should your hearts &amp; minds be ſtayed on them more then
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:178706:102"/> the living God? There is a great vanity and levity in mens minds. <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men that they are vanity.</hi> There is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Would you not build your houſe beſide him, and dwell in the meditation of his Name? This would fix and eſtabliſh you in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>when I awake, I am ſtill with thee.</hi> A little ſearching and experience diſcovereth emptineſs in all beſide, and therefore is it, that the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth ſooner from ſuch a particular Creature, then it expected; but here is <hi>one that is paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out;</hi> The more I ſearch and find, I find him
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:178706:102"/> the more above what I can ſearch and find. The Creatures are but painted and fair in mens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and at a diſtance, but the near injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them diſcovereth the deluſion, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man away aſhamed, becauſe he truſted. But the Lord God is, and there is no other, he is not as waters that fail no liar, he is an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fountain, the more you dig and draw, it runs the faſter, he will never ſend any away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed that truſt in him, becauſe they ſhall find more then they expected.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Soul that is ſtayed on meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, and knoweth him certainly, will be fixed in expectation from him. Our expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Creatures changeth, becauſe it is oft fruſtrat, diſappoyntment meets it, it is above what is in the Creature, and ſo it muſt meet with diſappoyntment; But as he is above our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, ſo is he far above our expectation: And if a mans experience anſwer his hope, he hath no reaſon to change his hope. The Lord hath often done things we looked not for, but we never looked for any thing according to the grounds of the word, but it was done, or a better then it. He doth not always anſwer our limitations, but if he give Gold, when we ſought Silver, are we not anſwered? Are we diſappoynted? There are three things that uſe moſt to diſquiet and toſs mens ſpirits, ſin and wrath, future events, and preſent calamities: Faith eſtabliſheth the Soul on God in all theſe, and ſuffereth it not to be driven to and fro, with theſe winds; It finds a harbour and refuge in God from all theſe. If he be purſued by the avenger of blood, Gods
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:178706:103"/> Wrath and Juſtice, here is an open City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge that he may run to, and be ſafe.

Entertain your own peace, do not grieve the Spirit who hath ſealed it: If you return to folly after he hath ſpoken peace to you, I perſwade you, you ſhall not maintain this peace, there may be peace with God, but no peace in thy Conſcience, as long as the whoredoms of thy heart are to the fore: Thou may be ſecure, but ſecurity is worſe then fear.

               <p>DOctrines, As things have their Seaſons and Times, every thing is beautiful in its Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; So there is no word of Truth, but it hath a Seaſon and Time in which it is beautiful: And indeed that is a great part of Wiſdom, to bring forth every thing in its Seaſon, to diſcern when and where, and to whom it is pertinent, and edifying, to ſpeak ſuch and ſuch Truths. But there is one Doctrine that is never out of Seaſon; And therefore, it may be preached in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon as the Apoſtle commandeth. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to many hearts it is always out of ſeaſon, and eſpecially in times of Trouble and Anguiſh, when it ſhould be moſt ſeaſonable, when the opportunity may commend the beauty of it; But in it ſelf and to as many as have ever found the power of it on their hearts, it is always the moſt ſeaſonable and pertinent Doctrine, I mean the very ſubject matter of this Text; The news of a Redeemer to Captive ſinners, it is in it ſelf ſuch glad tidings and ſhines with ſo much beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſplendor to troubled ſinners, that it caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abroad a luſter and beauty on the feet of the

It is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial in Affliction, whither outward or inward, and it is withall the only true comfort of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it allayeth the bitterneſs of things that croſs us, and filleth up the emptineſſe of things that pretend to pleaſe us. It giveth ſweetneſſe to the one, and true ſweetneſſe to the other. Reaſon then, that ſhould always be welcome to us, which we ſtand always in need of, that it ſhould always be new and freſh in our Affection, which is always recent and new in its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Efficacy toward us. Other news, how great or good ſoever, ſuppoſe they were able to fill the hearts of all in a Nation with Joy, yet they grow ſtale, they loſe their vertue within few days. What footſteps or remainder is of all the Triumphs and Trophies of Nations, of all their Solemnities for their victorious ſucceſſe at home and abroad. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>heſe great news, which once were the ſubject of the diſcourſe of, and delight of many thouſands, who report them now with delight; So theſe things that may cauſe Joy and Triumph to ſome at this time, as they cannot chooſe but make more hearts ſad then glad, ſo they will quickly loſe even that Efficacy they have, and become taſteleſs as the white of an Egg to them that are moſt raviſhed with them. But my Beloved, here is glade ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of a Redeemer come to Sion, to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which have no occaſion of ſadneſs in them to any, but to them who are not ſo happy as to conſider them or believe them, and they are this day after many hundred, I may ſay thouſand years ſince they were firſt publiſhed, as green

And a Sanctifying Vertue, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. 12. Now this is our errand to you, to invite you to come to theſe Waters; If ye thirſt, come to be quenched, if ye thirſt not, ye have ſo much the more need to come, becauſe your thirſt after things that will not profit you, will deſtroy you; and your unſenſibleneſs of your need of this is your greateſt miſery.</p>
               <p>That the words may be more lively unto us, we may call to mind the greateſt and deepeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne that hath been carried on in the world, by the Maker and Ruler of the world, is the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Chriſt his Son with the Church: This was primely intended when he made the world, as a Palace to Celebrat it into; This was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially aimed at, when he joyned <hi>Adam</hi> and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:178706:107"/> 
                  <hi>Eva,</hi> in the beginning of time together in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly joyned to the Church at the end of time, in the Paradiſe of Heaven. And this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle draws out as the Samplar and Arch-cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of all Mariages and Conjunctions in the Creatures, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. Now this being the great deſigne of God, of which, all other things done in time, are but the footſteps and low repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. But the great Queſtion is, how this ſhall be brought about, becauſe of the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and huge diſproportion of the Parties. <hi>He being the brightneſs of the Fathers glory,</hi> and we being wholly ecclipſed and darkned ſince our fall; <hi>He higher then the heaven of heavens,</hi> and we fallen as low as Hell into a dungeon of darkneſs and miſery, led away by ſin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, lying in that abominable poſture, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. Not only unſuitable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his Love, but fit to procure even the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all that paſs by.</p>
               <p>Now it being thus, the words do furniſh us with the noble reſolution of the Son, about the taking away of the diſtance, and the royal offer of the Father, to make the Match hold the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, both flowing from infinit Love, in the moſt free and ablolute manner can be imagined. The Sons Reſolution, which is withal the Fathers Promiſe, is to come into the world firſt, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem his Spouſe, and ſo to Marry her, <hi>And the Redeemer ſhall come unto Sion,</hi> &amp;c. The Fathers Offer (that he might not be wanting to help it forward) is to Diſpone by an irrevocable Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, having the force of an abſolute Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:178706:107"/> His Word and Spirit to Chriſt and his Seed, to the Church even to the end of the world, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.. <hi>As for me, this is my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> The Son hath done his part, and is to expreſs his infinit Love, infinit Condeſcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſtooping below his Majeſty: Now as for me, I will ſhew my good will to it, in my infinit Bounty and Riches of Grace to the Church, he hath given himſelf for her, I will give my Spirit, and thus it cannot but hold.</p>
               <p>We ſhall ſpeak a word then of theſe three; Firſt, what Eſtate and Condition Chriſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Church into, out of which, ſhe muſt be taken to be his Spouſe; Then what way and courſe is laid down by the Counſel of Heaven, to fill up the infinit diſtance between Chriſt and ſinners; and to cloſe all, we ſhall ſhew you the ſuitableneſs of theſe Promiſes, and the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fitneſs of this Doctrine, to the Church at this time <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Preached it, and at all times.</p>
               <p>The firſt is ſuppoſed in the words, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſupponeth Captivity or Slavery, Redemption of perſons importeth Captivity and Slavery of theſe perſons, and Redemption of other things that belong to perſons, importeth Sale, or Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our right to them. Of both, Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Redemption is the greateſt and moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; Yet both we have need of, for our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate and Fortune (ſo to ſpeak) is loſt, <hi>For all men have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 23. That inheritance of eternal Life, we have morgaged it, and given away our

                  </gap>ſſion, to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Poſterity. But O how, for how ſmall a thing did he give it away, for a little taſt of an Aple, he ſold his Eſtate; And both he and we may lament over it, as the King that was conſtrained to render himſelf and all his Army for want of Water, when he taſted it, for how ſmall a thing (ſaith he) have I loſt my Kingdom? Then our perſons are in a ſtate of Bondage, in Captivity and Slavery. Captives under the Wrath of God, and Slaves or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſin. There needed no greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and difformity between Chriſt and us, then this, our ſervitude and bondage to ſin, which truely is the baſeſt and moſt abominable Vaſſallage in the World. The abaſement of the Higheſt Prince, to the vileſt ſervitude under the baſeſt Creature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in his Dominion, is but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of that loathſome and ugly poſture of our Souls. This ſervitude doth in a manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man us, and transform us into Beaſts. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is that, which in the Holy Eyes of God, is more loathſome then any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; He ſeeth not that deformity in Poverty, Nakedneſſe, Sickneſſe, Slavery, let a man be as miſerable as <hi>Job</hi> on his Dung hill, it is not ſo much that, as the unſeen and undiſcerned Poſture and Habit of their Souls, that he abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth. Now what a Match is this, for the Higheſt and Holieſt Prince, the Son of the greateſt King and Heir of all things? But if
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:178706:108"/> you add to this Slavery, that Captivity under the Curſe and Wrath of God, that all men are ſhut up and incloſed in the priſon of Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and irrevocable Sentence of Condemnation, and given over by the righteous Judgement of God, to be kept by Satan in everlaſting Chains of Darkneſs: He keepeth men now, by the inviſible Cords of their own ſins, but theſe Chains of Darkneſs are reſerved for both him and men. Now indeed, this ſupperaddeth a great difficulty to the buſineſs, the other may be a difficulty to his Mind and Affection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing to procure Love, but all that may enforce Hatred and Loathing: But ſuppoſe his infinit Love could come over this ſtay, could leap over this Mountain by the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of it; Yet there is a greater impediment in the way, that may ſeem difficult to his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and it is the Juſtice and Power of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing ſinners and ſhutting them up for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wrath, till a due ſatisfaction be had from, or for them. You ſee then, how infinit the diſtance is betwixt him and us, and how great the difficulty is, to bring about this intended Union. Angels were ſent with flamming Swords to encompaſs the Tree of Life, and keep it from man, but man is environed by the Curſe of the Almighty God, the Juſtice, the Faithfulneſs, and the Power of God do Guard or ſet a watch about him, that there is no acceſs to him to ſave him, but by undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt danger, and undertaking the greateſt Party that ever was dealt withal, and the ſtricteſt and ſevereſt too.</p>

               <p>Now you ſee the great Difficulty is overcome and taken out of the way, Chriſt being made a Curſe, hath purchaſed a redemption from the Curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 13. But yet, there is another poynt of vaſt diſtance, I may ſay, con: trariety and enmity between us and him; he is Holy and undefiled, all fair and no ſpot in him; We are wholly defiled and depraved by ſin, our Souls are become the habitation of Devils, and a Cage of every unclean and hateful Bird; In a word, he hath not only our Enemies to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but our own hearts to conquer, and our Enmity to take away. This makes the wideſt ſeparation from him. Now he filled up much of the Diſtance, with his taking our fleſh, and he removed the great Difficulty, by dying in our fleſh, his Humiliation to be a Man brought him nearer us: And his further Humiliation, to be a Dying, Crucified and Buried Man, brought him yet a ſtep nearer us. But nearer he cannot come, for lower he cannot be, except he were a ſinner, which would marr the whole deſign, and take away all the Comfort of his likneſſe to us; Therefore, ſince he hath come ſo low
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:178706:113"/> down to us, it is ſuitable we be raiſed up one ſtep to meet him: And ſo the Exaltation of ſinners ſhall make up all the Diſtance, and bring the two parties to that long ſince deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and long deſired meeting. Now for this end and purpoſe, the Son undertakes the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his Church, from ſin and ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs als well as wrath; And therefore you have that, which is expreſſed as the Character of the redeemed in this <hi>Verſ.</hi> It is exponed as the great point or part of the Redemption it ſelf, by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>The Redeemer ſhall come to Sion, to turn all ungodlineſs from Jacob.</hi> And ſo his end was not only to be partaker of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to make us partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; And therefore the Father out of his Love to this buſineſſe, he promiſeth to ſend his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to dwell in our hearts, to make the Word ſound in our Mouths and Ears, and the Spirit to work in our hearts, and this Exaltation of ſinners to the participation of the Holy Spirit, together with Chriſts Humiliation, to partake of our Fleſh makes up the full Diſtance, and bringeth Chriſt and his Church to that holy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Impatience, and longing for the day when it ſhall be Solemnized in Heaven. <hi>The Spirit within us, ſayes come, and the bride ſayes come, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi> And he waits for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the Compleating and Adorning of all the reſt, that there may be one Jubilee for all and for ever. Now I wiſh we could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Abſolute and free Tenor of Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: There is much controverſy ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive about the Condition of the Covenant, about
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:178706:113"/> the Promiſes, whither Abſolute, or Conditional; And there is too much practical Debate in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Conſciences about this, how to find ſomething in themſelvs to fit and faſhion them for the Redemption. But truely if we would not diſjoyn and diſmember the Truth of God, but take it all intirely as one great deſign of Love and Metcy revealed to ſinners, and ſo conjoyn the Promiſes of the Covenant into one bundle, we would certainly find that it hath the Voice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> though it ſeem to have the Hand of <hi>Esau;</hi> we find an abſolute, moſt free and incondition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe, when there is a conditional ſtrain and ſhadow of words in ſome places. The truth is, the turning of ſouls from ungodlineſs, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a Condition exacted from us, as a Promiſe to be performed in us, and the chiefeſt part of Chriſts Redemption. And though ſome abuſe the grace of God, and turn it into wantonneſs and liberty: Yet certainly, this Doctrine that makes the greateſt part of the glad news of the Goſpel, to be Redemption from ſin and the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Spirit, is the greateſt perſwaſive to a godly Converſation, and the moſt deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all ungodlineſs.</p>
               <p>I thought to have ſpoken more of that third thing I proponed, but take it in a word. This was always proponed to the Church, as the ſtrongeſt Cordial, it was given here as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Conſolation in all their long Captivity, that this Redeemer was after wards to come, whoſe Vertue was then living, and preſent to the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and comforting of ſouls. It was thought enough to uphold in a moſt deſperat ſtrait. <hi>To</hi>

                  <hi>us a child is born,</hi> Iſai. 8. I wiſh we could take it ſo; Certainly it was the Character of a Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before Chriſts coming, that he was one that was looking and waiting for the Salvation of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> by this Redeemer. But now we are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Conſolation before and behind, Chriſt already come, ſo that we may in joy ſay, lo this is our God, we have waited for him; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers waited and longed, and we ſee him: and Chriſt ſhortly to come again without ſin, to our Salvation. And what could be able to take our Joy from us, if we had one Eye always back to his firſt coming, and another always forward to his comeing again?</p>

               <p>THis peoples condition aggreeth well with ours, though the Lords dealing be very different. The Confeſſory part of this Prayer belongeth to us now; And ſtrange it is, that there is ſuch odds of the Lords Diſpenſations, when there is no difference in our Cohditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Always, we know not how ſoon the complaint may be ours alſo. This Prayer was prayed long before the Judgment and Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity came one, ſo that it had a Propheſy in the boſome of it: Nay, it was the moſt kindly and affectionat way of warning, the people could get, for <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to pour forth ſuch a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as if he beheld with his Eyes the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as already come: And indeed it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us ſo to look on the Word, as if it gave a preſent beeing to things als certain and ſenſible, as if they were really. What ſtrange ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt be in us, when preſent things, inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judgments, committed ſins, do not ſo much affect us, as the forefight of them did move <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Always, as this was regiſtrat for the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:178706:115"/> peoples uſe, to cauſe them ſtill look on Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned, as performed and preſent, and anticipat the day of Affliction by repentance: and alſo to be a Patern to them, how to deal with God, and plead with him from ſuch grounds of Mercy and Covenant Intereſt; So it may be to us a warning, eſpecially when ſin is come to the Maturity, and our ſecure back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding Condition is with Child of ſad Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when the harveſt ſeemeth ripe to put the ſickle in to it.</p>
               <p>There is in theſe two <hi>Verſes,</hi> a confeſſion of their own ſinfulneſs, from which grounds they juſtify Gods proceeding with them; They take the cauſe upon themſelves, and juſtify him in his Judging, whither Temporal or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Plagues were inflicted. In this <hi>Verſe,</hi> they take a general ſurvey of their ſinful Eſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding themſelves unclean, and all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances and commanded Duties, which they counted once their righteouſneſs: And from this ground, they clear Gods dealing with them, and put their mouth in the Duſt, and ſo from the Lords Judgment they are forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enter into a ſearch of the Cauſe, ſo much ſin, and from diſcovered ſin, they pronounce God righteous in his Judgment: perceiving a great difference in the Lords manner of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them and their fathers, they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found it upon God who is righteous in all his ways, but retort it upon themſelves, and find a vaſt diſcrepance between themſelves and their fathers, <hi>Verſe</hi> 5. And ſo it was no wonder that Gods Diſpenſation changed upon them;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:178706:115"/> God was wont to meet others, to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gracious even to prevent ſtroaks; But now he was wroth with them, Nay, but there is good cauſe for it, <hi>They rejoyced and wrought righteouſneſs,</hi> but we have ſinned. And this may be ſaid in the general, never one needeth to quarrel God for ſevere dealing. If he deal worſe with one then with another, let every man look into his own boſome, and ſee reaſon ſufficient, yea, more provocation in themſelves then others. Always in this <hi>Verſe,</hi> they come to a more diſtinct veiw of their loathſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Any body may wrap up their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in a general notion of ſin, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves to be more touched with it, and condeſcend on particulars, yet ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars as comprehend many others. And in this Confeſſion, you may look on the Spirits work, having ſome Characters of the ſpirit in it. Firſt, they take a general view of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe and loathſome Eſtate by ſin: Not only do they ſee ſin, but ſin in the ſinfulneſſe of it and uncleanneſſe of it. Secondly, They not only conclude ſo of the Natural Eſtate they were born into, and the loathſomneſſe of their many foul ſcandals among them: But they go a further length, to paſſe als ſevere a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on their Duties and Ordinances, as God hath done, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. and 66. The ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth according to Scriptures Light, and not according to the dark ſpark of Natures Light; and ſo that which Nature would have busked it ſelf with as its Ornament, that which they had covered themſelves with as their Garment,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:178706:116"/> had ſpread their Duties as robs of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe over their ſins to hide them, all this now goeth under the name of filthineſſe and ſin; They ſee themſelves wrapt up in as vile raggs as they covered and hid; Commanded Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and manifeſt Breaches come in one Catego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And not only is it ſome of them which their own Conſcience could challenge in the time, but all of them and all kinds of them, Moral and Ceremohial, Duties that were moſt ſincere, had moſt Affection in them, all of them are filthy raggs now, which but of late were their righteouſneſle. Thirdly, there is an univerſality; not only of the Actions, but of Perſons, not only all the Peoples or Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes performances are abomination, but all of them, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and one and other, the holieſt of them come in, in this Category and Rank: <hi>we are all unclean,</hi> &amp;c. Though the people, it may be, could not joyn Holy <hi>Iſaiah</hi> with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet humble <hi>Iſaiah</hi> will joyn himſelf with the people, and come in in one prayer: And no doubt, he was als ſenſible of ſin now, as when he began to prophecy; and growing in holineſſe, he muſt grow alſo in ſenſe of ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Seing at the firſt ſight of Gods Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Glory, he cryed <hi>unclean,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6. 5. Certainly he doth ſo now, from ſuch a principle of acceſſe to Gods Holineſſe, which maketh him abhore himſelf in Duſt and Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Fourthly, They are not content with ſuch a general; but condeſcend to two ſpecial things, two ſpiritual ſins, to wit, Omiſſion, or ſhifting of ſpiritual Duties, which contained
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:178706:116"/> the ſubſtance of Worſhip: <hi>None calleth one thee,</hi> few or none, none to count upon, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth on thee, that is, careth for immediat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and approaching unto God in prayer, and meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Albeit External and Temple Duties be frequent, yet who prayeth in ſecret; or if any pray, that cannot come in compt, the Lord knoweth them not, becauſe they want the Spirits ſtamp on them. This muſt be ſome other thing, nor the general conviction of ſin which the world hath, who think they pray all their days; Here people who though they make many prayers, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. Yet they ſee them no prayers; and no calling on Gods Name now. But Fifthly, to make the challenge the more, and the confeſſion more ſpiritual and compleat, there is diſcovered unto them this ground of their ſlackneſſe and negligence in all ſpiritual Duties, <hi>None ſtirreth up himſelf to take bold one thee.</hi> Here is the want of the exerciſe of Faith: Faith is the Souls hand and grip, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27. 5. No body a waketh themſelves out of their deadneſſe and ſecurity, to lay hold on thee: Lord thou art going away, and taking goodnight of the Land, and no body is like to hold thee by the Garment: <hi>No Jacobs here, who will not let thee go, till thou bleſs them;</hi> None to prevail with thy Majeſty, every one is like to give Chriſt a free Paſport and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial to go abroad, and are almoſt Gada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens, to pray him to depart out of their Coaſts. There is a ſtrange louſneſſe and indifferency in mens ſpirits concerning the one thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:178706:117"/> Men ly by and dream over their days, and never putteth the Souls Eſtate out of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: None will give ſo much pains, as to clear their intereſt in thee, to lay hold on thee, ſo as they may make peace with thee. Now can there be a more ample and lively Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Eſtate, both of the Land and of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons of it. Since this muſt not be limited to the Nation of the Jews, though the Prophet ſpake of the generality of them: Yet no doubt, all mankind is included in the firſt <hi>ſix-Verſes;</hi> And any ſecure people may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the ſeventh <hi>Verſe,</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> applyeth even-ſuch like ſpeeches, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 13.) that were ſpoken, as you would think, of <hi>Davids</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies only; Yet the Spirit of God knowing the mind of the Spirit, maketh a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral uſe of their condition, to hold out the Natural Eſtate of all men out of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
               <p>But there are in theſe two <hi>Verſes,</hi> other two things, beſide the acknowledgment of ſin: Firſt, the acknowledgment of Gods Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in puniſhing them, for now they need not quarrel God, they find the cauſe of their ſading in their own boſome, they now joyn ſin and puniſhment together, wheras in the time of their proſperity, they ſeparated puniſhment from ſin, and in the time of their ſecurity in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, they ſeparated ſin from puniſhment; at one time making bare confeſſion of ſin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of Gods Juſtice, at another time, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and murmuring at his Judgments, without the ſenſe of their ſin; But now they joyn both
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:178706:117"/> theſe, and the ſight and ſenſe of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure maketh ſin more bitter, and to abound more, and to appear in the loathſome and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocking nature of it, ſo that their acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath an edge upon it. And again, the ſight and ſenſe of ſin maketh the Judgment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear moſt righteous, and ſtoppeth their mouth from murmuring. In the time of their impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency under the Rod, their language was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indifferent, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 2. <hi>The fathers have eaten ſour graps, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge.</hi> They have ſinned and we ſuffer; they have done the wrong and we pay for it: But it is not ſo now, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. The Fathers have done righteouſneſs in reſpect of us, and thou was good unto them, but we are all unclean, and have ſinned, and ſo we are puniſhed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they find ſome cauſe and ground in God of their general defection, not that he is the cauſe of their ſin, but in a righteous way he puniſhed ſin with ſin. God hid his Face, denyed ſpecial Grace and Influence; and ſo they ly ſtill in their ſecurity, and their ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſpiritual plague. Or this may be ſo read, none calleth on thy Name, when thou hid thy Face from us, and when thou conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us becauſe of our iniquities; And ſo it ſerveth to aggravat their deep ſecurity, that though the Lord was departing from them, yet none would keep him and hold him; Though he did ſtrike, yet they prayed not, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not awake them out of ſecurity, and ſo the laſt words, <hi>Thou haſt conſumed us,</hi> &amp;c. Are differently exponed and read; Some make it
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:178706:118"/> thus, as it is in the Tranſlation, <hi>Thou haſt hid thy face, and left us in a ſpiritual deadneſs,</hi> that ſo there might be no impediment to bring on deſerved Judgment; If we had called on thee, and laid hold on thee, it might have been prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we might have prevailed with God, but now our defence is removed, thou haſt given us up to a ſpirit of ſlumber, and ſo we have no ſhield to hold of the ſtroak, thou haſt now good leave to conſume us for our ſins: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe may be (Thou haſt ſuffered us to conſume in our iniquity, thou haſt given us up to the hand of our ſins:) And this is alſo a conſequent of his hiding his Face, becauſe thou hid thy Face, thou letteth us periſh in our ſins; There needeth no more for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but only help us not out of them, for we can ſoon deſtroy our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſin is in its own nature Ioathſome and maketh one unclean before God: Sins nature is filthineſs, vileneſs, ſo doth <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeak of himſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 5. when he ſaw Gods Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; So doth <hi>Job</hi> abhore himſelf, which is the Affection which turneth a mans face off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> loathſome object, when he ſaw God, <hi>Job</hi> 40. 4. and 42, 6. Look how loathſome our natural condition is holden out by God himſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. You cannot imagine any deformity in the Creature, any filthineſs, but it is there. The filthineſs and vileneſs of ſin ſhall appear, if we conſider firſt: Sin is a tranſgreſſion of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpiritual Command, and ſo a vile thing; <hi>The Command is holy and good,</hi> Rom. 7. And ſin violateth and goeth flat contrary
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:178706:118"/> to the Command, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3: When ſo juſt and ſo equitable a Law is given, God might have exacted other rigorous duties from us, but when it is ſo framed, that the Conſcience muſt cry out, all is equity, all is righteous and more then righteous, thou might command more and reward none: It is Juſtice to Command, but it is Mercy to Promiſe Life to obedience, which I owe: What then muſt the offence be, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a Juſt Command and ſo Holy. If Holineſs be the Beauty of the Creation, ſin muſt be the Deformity of it, the only ſpot in its Face.</p>
               <p>Secondly, look upon ſin in the ſight of Gods Holineſs and Infinit Majeſty, and O how hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous will it appear; And therefore no man hath ſeen ſin in the vileneſs of it, but in the Light of Gods Countenance. As <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Job</hi> 40. and 42. <hi>God is of purer eyes then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold iniquity,</hi> he cannot look on it, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. All other things beſide ſin, God looketh on them as bearing ſome mark of his own Image, <hi>all was very good, and God ſaw it,</hi> Gen. 1. and 2. Even the baſeſt Creatures God looketh on them, and ſeeth himſelf in them: But ſin is only Gods Eye-ſore, that his Holineſs cannot away with it is moſt contrary unto him. And as to his Soveraignty, it is an high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and rebellion done to Gods Majeſty, it putteth God off the Throne, will take no Law from him, will not acknowledge his Law, but (as it were) ſpitteth in his Face, and eſtabliſheth another God. There is no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo evil, that God will not own as his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:178706:119"/> work, and declare himſelf to be the Author of it, but only ſin; his Soul abhorreth it, his Holy Will is againſt it, he will have no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with it: It is ſo contrary to him, contradicteth his Will, debaſeth his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, deſpiſeth his Soveraignty, vilipendeth his Truth. There is a kind of infinitneſs in it: Nothing can expreſs it, but it ſelf, no name worſe then it ſelf to ſet it out; The Apoſtle can get no other Epithet to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 17. 13. <hi>Sinful ſin,</hi> ſo that it cometh in moſt direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition unto God. All that is in God, is God himſelf, and there is no Name can expreſs him ſufficiently; If you ſay <hi>God,</hi> you ſay more then can be expreſt by many thouſand other words; So is it here, ſin is purely ſin. God is purely Good and Holy, without mixture, Holineſs it ſelf: Sin is ſimply evil, without mixture, unholineſs it ſelf; What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in it, is ſin, is uncleanneſs: Sin is an infinit wrong, and an infinit and boundleſs fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, becauſe of the infinit Perſon wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is an Offence of infinit Majeſty: and the Perſon wronged aggravateth the Offence; If it be ſimply contrary to infinit Holineſs, it muſt be in that reſpect, infinit unholineſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, look upon the ſad Effects and Conſequences of ſin, how Miſerable, how Ruinous it hath made man, and all the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and how vile muſt it be? Firſt, Look on mans Native Beauty and Excellency, how Beautiful a Creature? But ſin hath caſt him down from the top of his Excellency: Sin
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:178706:119"/> made <hi>Adam</hi> of a Friend an Enemy, of a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier with God, an open Rebel: was not mans Soul of more price, nor all the world, ſo that nothing can exchange it? Yet hath ſin de baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and proſtitute it, to all vile filthy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, hath made the Immortal Spirit dwell on the Dunghil, feed on Aſhes, catch vanities, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities, pour out it ſelf to them, ſerve all the Creatures, where as it ſhould have made them ſervants, yea a ſlave to his own greateſt enemy, to the ground he treadeth upon: O what a degenerat Plant! It was a noble Vine once in Paradiſe, but ſin hath made it a wild one, to bring forth ſour Graps. What is there in all the world could defile a man? <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 20. <hi>Nothing that goeth out or cometh in, but ſin that proceedeth out of the heart.</hi> Man was all Light, his Judgment ſhined in to his Affections, and thorow all the Man: But ſin hath made all Darkneſſe, cloſed up the poor captive Underſtanding, hath built up a thick Wall of groſſe corrupted Affections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, ſo that Light can neither get in nor out. The Soul was like a clear running Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which yielded freſh clear ſtreams of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inclinations, Deſires, Affections, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and emptied it ſelf in the Sea of Immenſe Majeſty, from which, theſe Streams firſt flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But now it is a ſtanding putrified Puddle, that caſteth a vile ſtinck round about, and hath no iſſue towards God. Man was a Glorious Creature, fit to be Lord over the work of Gods own Hands, and therefore had Gods Image in a ſpecial manner, Holineſſe and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:178706:120"/> Gods Nature, a peece of Divinity was ſtamped on man, which outſhined all Created Perfections; The Sun might bluſh when it looked on him; For what was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Glory, to the Glory of Holineſſe and Beauty of Gods Image? But ſin hath robbed poor man of this Glorious Image, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced man, marred all his Glory, put on an helliſh likeneſſe on him: Holineſſe only putteth the differenc between Angels in Heaven and Devils in Hell: And ſin only hath made the difference, between <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and ſinners on the curſed ground, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſin hath ſo redounded through man unto all the Creation, that it hath defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and made it corruptible and ſubject to vanity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20. &amp;c. So that this is a ſpot in all the Creatures Face, that man hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and uſed all as weapons of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that now the Creature groaneth to be delivered.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It hath brought on all the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that is come on man; or that is to come; It hath brought on Death and Damnation as its wages, and the Curſe of the Eternal God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. How odious then an evil muſt it be, that hath ſo much evil in it, yea all evil in the boſome of it: Hell is not evil in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſin, for ſin deſerveth Hell: it hath ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, and made all the beautiful order of the Creation to change.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It ſeparateth man from God, which is worſt of all; And this is included in
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:178706:120"/> the Text, <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, or man,</hi> as a leprous man ſet apart, becauſe of polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that may not come to the Temple, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, ſo hath iniquity ſeparated between God and us, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59. 2. And O how ſad a Divorcement is this, it maketh men <hi>without God in the world, in whom we live and move and have our beeing, in whoſe favour is life, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> Now poor man is made Miſerable, deprived of his Felicity, which only conſiſted in enjoyment of God: Sin as a thick partition Wall is come in between; Enimity alſo is come in, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth old friends, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16, 17. And now no heavenly, or comfortable Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can break thorow: The Night of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is begun, which muſt prove everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except the partition Wall be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all muſt wither and decay as without the Sun.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Look on the Price paid for ſin, on the cleanſing that waſheth it away, and you may ſee unſpeakeable deformity and vileneſſe in it: The Redemption of the Soul is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Silver and Gold and precious Stones will not do it, that would be utterly contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: What (ſaith God) preſumptuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, will thou give me a farthimg in payment of a ſumm, which all the world ſold at the deareſt, would not diſcharge, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49 7, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>It is no corruptible thing, but the blood of the son of God.</hi> O what muſt the Debt be, when the price is ſo infinit? The Son of God muſt dy; Nay, <hi>It is not ſacrifice or offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:178706:121"/> 
                  <hi>lo, I come to do thy will,</hi> it is Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that is the Ranſom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6, 7. And it is not much Sope or Nitre, it is not much repentance and tears that will waſh away this filthineſſe, No; it is of a deeper dy, <hi>it is crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ingrained filthineſs,</hi> Jer. 2. 22. And <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Blood of bulls and goats cannot do it, but only the blood of the immaculat Lamb, offered up by himſelf,</hi> Heb. 10. 4, 5. <hi>the blood of him who, by the eternal Spirit offered up himſelf without ſpot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. What muſt ſin be, that muſt have ſuch a Fountain opened for it? It muſt be ſtrange uncleanneſſe, when the Blood of Chriſt only can cleanſe it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We all,</hi> &amp;c.] Mark, Secondly, ſin hath gone over us all, and made all mankind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 22. and 10. Every one of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> poſterity is born unclean, <hi>For who can bring an clean thing out of an unclean,</hi> Job 14. 4: Conſider firſt, how ſin defaced innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> how one ſin made him ſo vile, and ſpoyled him of the Divine Nature, and ſo the root was made unclean, and the branches muſt follow the root, and ſo are we all born and conceived in ſin, <hi>Plal.</hi> 51. 5. We carry in us Original Corruption, flowing from the firſt actual ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and this maketh poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before they do good or evil, to be abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably vile in Gods ſight, even as the Child is ſet out, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. Every one cometh of evil Parents, all come of <hi>Adam</hi> the Rebel: What a loathſome ſight would a Child be to us ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, <hi>caſt out in the open field to the loathing of</hi>

Every man ſhall find his Compt paſt counting: One days faults would weary you, but what will your whole life do? Known ſins are innumerable, what muſt unknown be? Every mans heart is like the troubled Sea, that caſteth up mire and dirt dayly, and cannot be at reſt. The heart is dayly flowing and ebbing in this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, it cometh out dayly to the borders of all the Members; And there are ſome high ſpring Tides, when ſin aboundeth more. When in one Member of the Tongue a world of evil is, What can be in all the Members? And what in the Soul, that is more capable then all the world? Well then, every man hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and hath ſinned alſo in his own perſon, and ſealed <hi>Adams</hi> firſt rebellion, by ſo many thouſand Actions like it: Every man hath approven the ſin that firſt ruined man, and made himſelf much more loathſome nor <hi>Adam</hi> was: Therefore all mankind may ſay, <hi>we all are as an unclean thing.</hi> Now from all this, we

               <p>NOt only are the direct breaches of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand uncleanneſle, and men originally and actually unclean, but even our holy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, our commanded Duties: Take a mans ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, religion and all, his univerſal inherent Righteouſneſſe, all are filthy raggs: And here the Church confeſſeth nothing, but what God accuſeth her of, <hi>Iſai,</hi> 66. 3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11, 12, 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This people was much in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial and External Duties, and therefore they cryed, <hi>the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,</hi> as if this would have outcryed all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins: therefore were they proud, and lords in their o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>wn eſtimation and innocent, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 31, 35. They thought the many good ſervices they did to God, might compenſe all their wrongs <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 6, 7. They gave a price to Juſtice for their ſins, even a confeſlion of it by offering a Lamb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a purpoſe to amend. But lo, what ſenſe the Prophet hath of all this, <hi>Lord all our righteouſneſſe is</hi> filthy likewiſe; Albeit we
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:178706:124"/> have paid the Debt of ſins with Duties, yet now we ſee all theſe are ſins themſelves, and muſt have another ſacrifice, ſo that all matter of boaſting is now removed, and we are ſtript na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of all righteouſneſſe; We covered our fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe before, with Duties, now both the one and the other is filthy. We would look upon two ſorts of righteouſneſſes, the natural mans and the converted mans, upon the ones Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fair Profeſſion, and upon the others real or true Grace in diſcharge of Duties, and we ſhall find good reaſon to conclude both the one and the other under filthineſſe, ſo that there is no ground of boaſting, no inherent righteouſneſſe can make us accepted before God.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, whatever men can do from Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Principles, all the flower and perfection of mens Actions, both civil and religious, is but abominable before God, as long as their perſons are unjuſtified. Every performance is defiled by the uncleanneſſe of the perſon. And therefore <hi>God heareth not ſinners, Joh.</hi> 8. That is unjuſtified ſinners, though they pray much, yet God heareth them not. And this is lively expreſſed by <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14. As the Prieſts Holy Garments and Fleſh could not make Bread or Pottage holy, but the unclean body could make theſe unclean; So this Nations and Peoples performances and Holy Duties, could not make them Holy, and their Perſons clean; But their unclean perſons and actions made all their performances unclean: The ſolemn meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could not make them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but their unclean perſons, made their
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:178706:125"/> ſolemn meetings and religious Duties vile and abominable in Gods ſight: And thus <hi>to the unclean all things are unclean, even their mind and conſcience, Tit.</hi> 1. 15. The unbelieving man who is born unclean, and defiled with ſo much original corruption, and ſo many actual tranſgreſſions, defileth all things he toucheth; As a dead body, or a leprous garment under the Law, made all unclean it touched, and nothing could make it holy by touching of it. So all your Civility, all your Profeſſion will never contribute to the cleanſing of your Perſon; And your perſons ſhall defile all your moſt clean actions. God loveth not that ſtock of <hi>Adam,</hi> and all that groweth on it, muſt be hateful; He is only well pleaſed in Jeſus Chriſt, and with thoſe who are tranſplanted out of rotten <hi>Adam,</hi> into the true Vine Jeſus, it is ſuch fruit only that can be acceptable: Therefore until you be ſprinkled with clean water, and made clean ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the new Covenant way, you cannot pleaſe God. Believe this, your ſins and your duties are one, your Oaths and your Prayers are in the ſame account with God. What have you then to build upon, when all this is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? You muſt once be ſtript naked of all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings; and will not your nakedneſs then be great: The Phariſee went away unjuſtified, and the poor repenting ſinner juſtified. What was the reaſon? There are not many of you have ſuch a fair venture for Heaven as he had, ſo many Prayers, Faſtings, Alms, to ground your Hope on. Nay, but all this would never ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify his perſon, becauſe once he was unclean,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:178706:125"/> come of <hi>Adam,</hi> and had contracted more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, and all that is like the leprous Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment defiling all that cometh near it; So that whatever hath any dependence on a ſon of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> muſt contract filthineſſe. Now I ask your Conſciences, have you ſo many ſpecious cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings to adorn your ſelf with? Is not your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſpotted, and not ſo clean, as the young ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Man and the religious Phariſee? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no, and yet you have no other ground to plead the acceptation of your perſons upon, but only this, your Prayers and Tears, or ſome ſuch Duty performed by you. Well, all is unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſince your perſons were once unclean, no Sope nor Nitre can waſh it, no holy fleſh make it holy, no good wiſhes nor duties can make it acceptable. Did not this people think of their Duties as much as you do? And had more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to do; for our Congregations have not ſo much form of godlineſſe as they had, and yet God ſolemnly proteſteth to them, that all their works were defiled, even theſe which they took to waſh themſelves with, ſo your repentance and tears muſt be als filthy, as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Secondly, the uncleanneſſe of mens practice maketh unclean performances, <hi>unclean hands make unclean prayers,</hi> Iſai. 1. 15. When men go on in ſin, and uſe their members as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſſe againſt God, and guiltineſſe is above their head unrepented of, and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, then whatever the members act for God in religious Duties, it muſt be alſo abominable, for will God take prayers from ſuch a mouth,

                  </gap> curſing cometh out of? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12 Shall ſweet water come out of one Fountain with bitter? Or can a Fig Tree bear both Thiſtles and Graps: Certainly, profane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation muſt make unclean profeſſion. And therefore your coming to the Church and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, your praying in your Families or ſuch like, muſt of neceſſity be defiled, ſince out of the ſame mouth cometh curſing, railing, lying filthy ſpeeches: Your tongues are ſo often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Gods diſhonour, to blaſpheme his Name; to ſlander your Neighbours, to reproach the Saints, that all your prayers muſt be of the ſame ſtamp, and als bitter as the other ſtream of your actions: When you ſtretch forth your hands to make many prayers, to take the Bread and Wine, ſhall not God hide his Face from ſuch hands, as are unclean with many abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, ſome murdering, ſome abuſing their Neighbours, ſome Sabbath-breaking, ſome filthineſſe, how oft have your hands and feet ſerved you to evil turns; And therefore your good turns will never come in remembrance. Nay, believe it, you cannot be heard of God while you cover any offence. And this I may ſay in general, even to the Saints; any known ſin given way to, and intertained without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolment, without wreſtling againſt it, hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the acceptation of your ſolemn approaches. <hi>If your heart regard iniquity, ſhall God hear?</hi> Pſ. 66. 18. No, believe it, the leaſt ſin that you may judge at firſt venial, and then give it tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and indulgence, ſhall ſeparat between Gods Face and you: Your prayers are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:178706:126"/> becauſe of ſuch an idol perked up in the heart beſide God, that getteth the Honour and Worſhip due to him, and God muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you according to it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19. 1, 3, 4. God will not be enquired of ſuch as give allowance to ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 2, 3, 4. And on the other hand, no ſin how great and hainous ſoever can hinder Gods gracious acceptation, when Souls fly unto Jeſus and turn their back upon ſin, or giveth it no heart allowance: And to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude I ſay, all that you do or touch in a Duty muſt be defiled, becauſe your whole way is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 12, 13, 14. Think you to ſin all the week thorow, and worſhip God on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, will you lie, ſwear, commit adultery, rail and curſe, and come and ſtand before me, ſaith the Lord? No certainly, you cannot be accepted; And will you hate reformation in your lives, and yet take his Covenant in your mouth, and call your ſelves by his Name, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?</hi> And ſhall not God challenge you for that als much, as for your ſwearing, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed the Lord putteth all in one Roll, and you need not pleaſe your ſelves in ſuch things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 9, 10. For it is all one to you to go to Tavern to drink, and come to the Sermon, to blaſpheme Gods Name, and call on it, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanity of the one defileth the other, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the other, cannot make you holy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the natural mans performances want the uprightneſs, reality and ſincerity that is required, it is but a painted Tomb, full of rottenneſs within, it is but a ſhadow without
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:178706:127"/> ſubſtance, for he wanteth the ſpiritual part of worſhip, which God careth for, <hi>who will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped in ſpirit and truth,</hi> Joh. 4. 23. Now what is it that the moſt part of you can ſpeak of, but an outſide of ſome few duties, ſoon numbered. You hear the preaching, and your hearts wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about your buſineſs: You hear, and are not ſo much affected, as you would be to hear ſome old ſtory, or fable told you: A ſtage play acted before this generation, would move them more then the Goſpel doth: So that Chriſt may take up this Lamentation; <hi>We have piped to you, and you have not dan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, lamented to you, and you have not mourned.</hi> You uſe to tell over ſome words in your prayers, and are not ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in any approach to God, as in twenty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of the world. Whatever you plead of your hearts rightneſs, and have recourſe to it, when your converſation cannot defend you, yet your hearts are the worſt of all, and have no up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs towards God, for you know that what Duties you go about, it is not from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle, but from Education or Cuſtome, or conſtraint. Are you upright, when you are forced for fear of cenſure to come here, or to pray at home? Is that ſincerity and ſpiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? And for the more poliſhed and refined profeſſors, you have this moth in your perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and this flea to make your Oyntment to ſtink, that you do much, to be ſeen of men, therefore what little fervour of ſpirit is in ſecret Duties; There you may meaſure your alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and your life. And O how weariſome, how lifeleſs are ſecret approaches, you would
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:178706:127"/> not have many errands to God, if you thought no body looked upon you. And for ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is a Myſtery in all mens practice: Who directeth his Duty to Gods Glory? If you get ſome flaſh of liberty, you have your deſire; But who miſſeth Gods preſence in Duties, which a world will approve? Who go mourning as without the Sun, even when you have the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of Ordinances and walketh in the light of them?</p>
               <p>And fourthly, though your performances had uprightneſs of heart going alongs, and much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in them, yet all are filthy, becauſe of want of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt. When you make your Duties a covering of your ſins, and think to ſatisfy Gods Juſtice for the reſt of your faults, by doing ſome point of your Duty, then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but be polluted in his ſight. And this very thing was the cauſe of Gods rejecting the Jews righteouſneſs, even becauſe they did not look to the end of the Myſtery, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Did not pull by the vail of Ceremonies, to ſee the Immaculat Lamb of God ſlain for ſin. And therefore doth the Lord ſo quarrel with them, as if he had never commanded them to do ſuch things, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. 12, 13. <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands? bring no more vain oblations,</hi> all is Abomination. Even as God ſhould ſay to you, when you come to the Church; who required you to come? Who commanded you to come to hear the Preaching? What have you to do to pray? What warrand have you to communicat? All your Praying, Hearing, Communicating, is Abomination; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:178706:128"/> you to do theſe things? Would you not think it a fooliſh Queſtion? You would ſoon anſwer, that God himſelf commanded you, and will he not let us do his bidding. Indeed this people, (no doubt) have ſaid ſo in their heart, and wondered what it meant. Nay, but here is the Myſtery, you go about theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Duties not in a commanded way, and ſo the Obedience is but Rebellion: You bring Offerings and Incenſe, and think that I am pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified when you bring Alms, you judge you have given me a recompenſe, wheras, all that is mine, and what pleaſure have I in theſe things? I never appointed you Sacrifices for this end, but to lead you in to the knowledge of my Son, which is to be ſlain in the fulneſs of time, <hi>and by one offering to perfect all.</hi> I commanded you to look on Jeſus Chriſt ſlain, in the ſlain Lamb, and ſo to expect Remiſſion and Salvation in him; But you never looked to more nor the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and made that your Saviour and Mediator: And therefore it is all Abomination: When you ſlay a Lamb, and offer Incenſe, it is all one thing, as to cut off a Dogs neck, or kill a Man; So may the Lord ſay to this Generation, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you to pray, to repent and mourn for ſin; to come and hear the Word, but withal you muſt deny all theſe, and count your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants, you muſt ſingly caſt your Souls burthen on Chriſt Jeſus. But now, (ſaith the Lord) who commanded your repentance, for when you ſit down to pray, or come in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to confeſſe ſin before the Congregation, you think you are waſhen; When you have ſaid,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:178706:128"/> you have ſinned, and if you come to the length of Tears and Sorrow, Oh then ſure you are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, though in the mean time you have no thought of Jeſus Chriſt, and knoweth no uſe of him. Therefore, faith the Lord, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you to do theſe things? You think you have ſatisfied for your ſin, when you pay a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, but who requireth this? I will reckon with you for theſe, als well as the ſins you pray and mourn for, becauſe you do not ſingly look to Chriſt Jeſus, Now, if he had never come to the world, your ground of confidence would not fail you; For you might have prayed als much, mourned and confeſſed, and promiſed amendment, and ſo you paſt by <hi>the Son of God, in whom only the Father is well pleaſed.</hi> Think then upon this, whatever you make your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, there needeth no other thing to make it filthy, but to make it your righteouſneſſe: Your confidence in your good heart to God, prayer day and night, and ſuch like, is the moſt loathſome thing in Gods Eyes: Except you come to this, to count your prayers, as God doth, among your oaths, to count your ſolemn Duties, among profane ſcandalous Actions, as the Lord doeth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. and 66. 3. Then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, you do adorn your ſelves with them, and cover your nakedneſſe of other faults, with ſuch leaves as <hi>Adam</hi> did, but you ſhall be more diſcovered; Your Garment is als filthy, as that it hideth, even becauſe you make that uſe of it to hide your ſin, and cover it.</p>
               <p>Next, The Lords Children have no ground of boaſting either, from their own righteouſneſſe;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:178706:129"/> The holieſt Saint on Earth muſt abhore himſelf in Duſt and Aſhes, and holy <hi>Iſaiab</hi> joyneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in with a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now you ſhall find good ground why it muſt be ſo. Firſt, There are ordinarly many ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes in our holieſt Actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpots on our clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Garment, often formality eateth up the life of Duties, and preſenteth a Body without a Soul in it: You ſit down to pray out of cuſtome, morning and evening: And if there were no more to prove it, this may ſuffice: When pray you but at ſuch times?

                  </gap>ſſity conſtraineth when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offereth; and ſo it is like the worlds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed houres. How great deadneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition creepeth in, ſo that it is the ordinary complaint, yea, all prayers filled with it, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any room for other petitions, becauſe of the want of frame for prayer it ſelf: The word is heard as a diſcourſe, and on whom hath it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to ſtirr up Affections, either of joy or of trembling? Chriſtians, you come not to hear God ſpeak, and ſo you meet with empty Ordinances, God is not in them. How often do crooked and ſiniſter ends creep in, and byaſs the Spirit; Men ask to ſpend on their luſts, and to ſatisfy their own ambition; Some would have more Grace to be more Eminent; or to have a more pleaſant Life; And this is but the ſeeking to ſpend on your luſts. If Affection
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:178706:129"/> run in the Channel of a Duty, it is often muddy, and runneth thorow our Corruptions: Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Duties is principled with carnal Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Self-love. Will not often the Wind of Applauſe in company, fill the ſails, and make your courſe ſwifter and freer, nor when you are alone. And often much love to a part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cular, maketh more in ſeeking it. And that which is a Moth to eat up and conſume all our Duties, is conceit and ſelf confidence in going about them, and attributing to our ſelf after them. It is but very rare, that any man both Acteth from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as the principle, and alſo putteth over his work on Chriſt ſingly as the end. Alas too often do men draw out of Chriſts Fulneſſe and raiſe up their own glory upon it, and adorn themſelves with the ſpoyls of his honour; For we uſe to pray from a habit of it, and go to as men acquainted with it, and when we get any ſatisfaction to our own minds, O how doth the Soul return on it ſelf, and goeth not forward as it goeth; It is ſo well pleaſed with it ſelf, when it getteth liberty to approach, that it doth not put all over on Jeſus, and take ſhame to it ſelf. As long as there is a body of Death within, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe cannot be pure and unmixed; Our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties run thorow a dirty Channel, and cannot chooſe but contract filth; While ſin lodgeth under one roof ſo near Grace, Grace muſt be in its exerciſe marred, and therefore the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle muſt cry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>The good that I would, I do not, but the evil which I would not, that I do.</hi> And Verſe 24. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi>

And therefore, you might cry down all your perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, when you could challenge them with no particular blot, with this, All is ſhort of the command, and infinitly ſhort. I have been aiming at holineſs ſo long, I have ſtretched out my ſtrength, and what have I attained? It may be, I have outſtriped equals, and there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be ſome diſtance between me and others; Nay, but the command is unſpeakably more before me, nor I am before others. I have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a ſpan of that boundleſs perfection of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; It is but a grain weight of the eternal weight of grace, and I muſt forget it, and ſtand before God, as if I had Ioſt mind of duties, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his preſence, as if I had attained nothing;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:178706:130"/> for the length that is before my hand, drowneth up all attainments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nay, but put the caſe man were perfect, <hi>yet ſhould he not know his ſoul, but deſpiſe his life; The Lord putteth no truſt in his ſervants, and his Angels he chargeth with folly, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are not clean in his ſight, how then muſt man be abominable, that hath his foundation in the duſt, and drinketh in iniquity like water? How ſhould God magnifie him? or he be righteous that is born of a woman?</hi> Job 25. 4, 6. and 15. 14, 15. and 4. 18, 19. <hi>Job</hi> was a great length in the ſight of his own vileneſs, and Gods holineſs, when he ſaw this, <hi>Though I were perfect, yet I would not know it, but deſpiſe it, I would not anſwer him, though I were righteous,</hi> Chap. 9. 14, 15, 21. So unſpeakably pure and clean is his Holineſs, that all created holineſs hath a ſpot in it before his, and evaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as the Stars diſappear when the Sun riſeth, which ſeem ſomething in the darkneſs. The Angels holineſs, the Heavens glory, is nothing to him, <hi>before whom the Nations are as nothing,</hi> ſo that it is all the wonder of the world, that ever God ſtooped ſo far below himſelf, even to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Adam,</hi> as to make ſuch a Covenant with him, to account him righteous in obedience. <hi>What is man that thou ſhould magnifie him?

Since we once ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, how ſhould our righteouſneſs ever come in remembrance? Therefore hath God choſen ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to cover mans wickedneſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs both, with his own righteouſneſs, his Sons Divine-humane righteouſneſs, which is ſo ſuited in his infinit wiſdom for us: It is a mans righteouſneſſe, that it may agree with men, and be a fit garment to cover them; It is Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, that it may be beautiful in Gods eyes, for he ſeeth his own image in it. And it is not the cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Saint-holineſſe muſt have a covering above, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cover our nakedneſſe: And all the ſongs of them that follow the Lamb, make mention of his righteouſneſſe, even of his only. The Lamb is the light and Sun of the City, the Lamb is the Temple of it, in a word, he is all that is beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and glorious: Every Saint hath put on the Lord Jeſus, and is perfect thorow his comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: At leaſt, if the holineſſe of ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, be the glorious habit above; yet all the beauty and glory of it is from Chriſt Jeſus whoſe image it is, and the Spirit whoſe work it is. It ſhall be ſtill true, All our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, as ours, is filthy, and all holineſſe, as it hath a relation to us, cannot pleaſe God, it muſt be ſpotted before his pure eyes, but only it
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:178706:131"/> is accepted and clean, as it is Chriſts and the Spirits, as it is his own garment put upon us, and his own comlineſſe making us perfect. It is not ſo much the inherent cleanneſs of the Saints robs that maketh them beautiful in his eyes, as this, <hi>That they are waſhed in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 7. 14.</p>
               <p>Now from all this we would ſpeak a word to two ſorts of you: There is one great point of Religion that is the principal and foundation of all other, even free Juſtification by Faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, without our own righteouſneſs. And the moſt part ſtumble here in the entry: It is the greateſt obſtruction of ſouls coming to Chriſt Jeſus, even the ignorant and blind conceit and fancy that almoſt every man hath of himſelf, and his own performances: The world will not make many believe the half of the evil of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that is ſpoken in the Word. If you have a general conviction of ſinfulneſſe and miſery, yet you think to help it. If you ſin, you uſe to make an amends, run to your prayers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to give God a recompence, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your own Conſciences: Speak now, is not this the way you think to be ſaved? I ſhall do what I can, pray and mourn for ſin, and what I am not able to do, God muſt forgive, you will do all you are able, or can, and Gods mercy muſt come in to ſupply the want of your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; But this is to put a new piece of cloath in an old garment, to make the rent worſe: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you have no other ground of confidence in the world, nothing to anſwer the challenge of Conſcience, or ſatisfie Juſtice but this, <hi>I</hi> repent,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:178706:132"/> I am ſorry, I mourn, I ſhall amend, I reſolve never to do the like again. Now then from this ground we would declare unto you in the Lords Name, you are yet unclean, both in perſons and actions unjuſtified, becauſe you have no other covering but your own duties and performances: And let theſe be examined, and weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary, and they will be found light. <hi>All your righteouſneſſe</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>is filthineſſe:</hi> You are unclean, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, both by birth and education, you have often defiled your ſelves with ſins, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: Now I ask you, How will you cover that uncleanneſſe and nakedneſſe? How will you hide it from Gods eyes, and your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? You know no way but this, I will pray, I will repent, and amend. So then you cover your ſelf with prayer, with ſorrow and tears, and a reſolution of amending, this then is all your covering and ornament, ſomething done by you; as many will make the wings of two good works ſtretch themſelves out ſo far, as to cover and hide a multitude of offences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Therefore I declare in the Lord Jeſus his Name unto you, whoſe Conſcience muſt go alongs in the acknowledgment and owning of your caſe, that you have covered your ſelves with your own righteouſneſſe, that you have taken as filthy rags to cover your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe and ſin with, as your ſins are, and ſo, you have made an addition to your uncleanneſs, you are more unclean by your prayers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance then before: And ſo God is of more pure eyes, then to look graciouſly on ſuch as you
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:178706:132"/> are. You have gone about to eſtabliſh your own righteouſneſſe, and hath not known the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God, and ſo you have come ſhort of it; you are yet perſons in a ſtate of enmity, God is your Judge, you are rebels: It concerns you much to heed this well, to judge of your own actions and perſons as God judgeth of them, for if God ſhall judge one way, and you judge ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, you may be far miſtaken in the end. If you have ſo good an opinion of your ſelves and your duties, that you can plead intereſt in God for them, and abſolve your ſelves from ſuch grounds: And if God have not the ſame judgement, but rather think as evil of your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as of your curſing, and abhor the thing that ſatisfieth you, will it not be dreadful in the end? For his judgement ſhall ſtand, and you will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumb in judgement, ſince you croſſed Gods mind. Therefore we would have you ſolidly drink in this principle of Religion, That man is ſo unclean, and God ſo abhorreth him, that whatever he doth, or can do, it cannot make him righteous, that no good action can make him acceptable, and take away the uncleanneſs of the evil actions; and that any ſinful action taketh away all the cleanneſs of the good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Once believe this, If I ſhould ſweat out my life in ſerving God, and never riſe off my knees, If I ſhould give my body to the fire for the truth, If I ſhould melt away in tears for ſin, all this is but filthy raggs, and I can never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God for all that, but the matter of my condemnation groweth: If I juſtifie my ſelf, my own mouth proves me perverſe: God needeth
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:178706:133"/> no more but my good deeds to condemn me for, in all juſtice: And therefore it is a thing impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I will never put forth a hand, or open a mouth upon that account any more. I will ſerve God, becauſe it is my duty, but life I will not expect by my ſervice, when I have done all, it is wholly mercy that I am accepted; my good works ſhall never come in remembrance, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to be found, not having my own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, I will appear among the ungodly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as one that hath no righteouſneſſe, that I may be juſtified only by faith in Jeſus Chriſt. I ſay, drink in this truth, and let it ſettle in your hearts, and then we would hear numbers cry, <hi>O what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as for you who have fled unto Chriſts righteouſneſſe only, &amp; have caſt away your own as dung and droſs, as filthy raggs, as you have done right in the point of Juſtification, judge ſo likewiſe after it. We would exhort you to judge ſo of your beſt actions that are the fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, judge ſo of them as you have a hand in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All our righteouſneſs:</hi> Mark, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> a holy Prophet joyneth himſelf in with the multitude. And the truth is, the more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the more humility and ſelf-abaſing; for what is holineſs, I pray you, but ſelf-denial, the abaſing of the creature, and exalting of Chriſt Jeſus. This is the Croſs that the Saints muſt all bear, <hi>Deny your ſelf, and follow me.</hi> Grace doth not ſwell men above others, it is gifts, ſuch as Knowledge that puffeth up; Charity or Love puffeth not up. Men are naturally high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for pride was the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and grace
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:178706:133"/> cometh to level men, to make the high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains valleys for Chriſts Chariot; It maketh men ſtoop low to enter the door of the Kingdome. Therefore if you have attained any meaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond others, if you would prove it real grace and holineſſe, do not exalt your ſelves above others, be not high minded, come down and ſit among the ungodly, among the unclean, and let not grace given diminiſh the low eſtimation of your ſelf in your ſelf: There is a growing that is but a fancy, and mens conceit, when men grow above Ordinances, above other Chriſtians, and can ſee none or few Chriſtians but themſelves, ſuch a growth is not real, its but fancy, its but ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and wind, and muſt be pricked to let it out. A holy Prophet came in among an unclean peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he did not ſay, <hi>Stand by, I am bolier then thou.</hi> Such a man as can find no Chriſtian about him, even though to the judgement of all others, they ſeek God more then he, ſuch a man hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſolid grace, his holineſs is profane holineſs, and proud holineſs; for true holineſs is humble holineſs, and in honour pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is a great fault among thoſe who have fled to Chriſts righteouſneſs in Juſtification, that they uſe to come full from duties, as a ſtomach from a honey comb. Oft times we make our liberty and acceſs to God, the ground of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, and according to the ebbings and flowings of our inherent righteouſneſs, ſo doth the faith and confidence of Juſtification ebb and flow. Chriſtians, this ought not to be. In ſo doing, you make your own righteouſneſs your righteouſneſs before God: for when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:178706:134"/> in the point of duty, maketh you queſtion your intereſt ſo often, is not the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of your minds in duties, made the ground of your pleading intereſt. Give you liberty and acceſs, you can believe any thing, remove it, and you can believe nothing. Certainly this is a ſandy foundation, you ought to build nothing on performances, you ſhould be as vile in your own eyes, and think your nakedneſs as open, when you come neareſt God, when you have moſt livelineſs, as when he hideth his face &amp; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty withereth; will filthy raggs be your ornament? No Chriſtians, be more acquaint with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted righteouſneſs of the Immaculat Lamb of God, and find as great neceſſity of covering your cleaneſt duties with it, as your fouleſt faults, and thus ſhall you be kept ſtill humble and vile in your own eyes, and have continual imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Chriſt Jeſus: your beſt eſtate ſhould not puff you up, and your worſt eſtate ſhould not caſt you down. Therefore be much in the ſearch of the filthineſs of your holy actions; This were a ſpiritual ſtudy, a noble diſcovery to unbowel your duties, to divide them, and give unto God what is Gods, and take unto your ſelves what is your own: The diſcovery of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs in them, needeth not hinder his praiſe; And the diſcovery of grace in them, needeth not marr your ſham<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, we would alſo preſs you from this ground to long much to be clothed upon with
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:178706:134"/> immortality, to put off the filthy raggs of time, and earth-righteouſneſs, and to be clothed upon with the white robs of the righteouſneſs of the Saints. As you would dwell near the fountain here, and be ſtill waſhing your garments, and offering all your ſacrifices in him who ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all, ſo would you pant and thirſt for this ſpotleſs garme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Therefore Chriſtians, every one of you aſpire higher, ſit not down in attainments, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what is behind, and preſſe forward: let per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſſe be in your eye and purpoſe, ſit not behind it: All our time-duties have much fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe; long for the pure ſtream that waters the City above: Grace is not in its native place, it is corrupted and mixed here: Heaven is the own Element of it, and there is grace without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Undervalue all your performances, till you be above, where that which is in part, ſhall be done away, where no unclean thing enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

               <p>But thirdly, Sins and iniquities have a great influence in the decay of Nations and Perſons, and change of their outward condition, when it is joyned with the wind of Gods diſpleaſure. The calamity of this people is ſet down in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent terms, alluding to a tree in the fall of the leaf: We (ſaith he,) were once in our Land as a green tree busked round about with leaves and fruit: our Church and State was in a flou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſhing condition, at leaſt, nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make outward ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, It is familiar in the Scripture, that people in a proſperous condition are compared unto <hi>a green tree flouriſhing,</hi> Pſal. 37. 35. The wickeds proſpeting is like a green Bay tree ſpreading himſelf in power, ſpreading out his arms, as it were, over moe Lands to conquer them, over moe people to ſubject them. And this is often the temptation of the godly, and ſo doth the Lord himſelf witneſs of this people. Jer. 11. 16. <hi>I have called thy name a green Olive tree, fair and of goodly fruit.</hi> This was once their name, though it be now changed. Now they are called a fading withering tree without both leaves and fruit. Now their place doth not ſo much as know them, they are removed as in a moment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 36. And this compariſon giveth us to underſtand ſomething of the nature of humane glory and pomp. The fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt beautiful excellency in the world, the proſperity of nations and people is but like the glory of a tree in the ſpring or ſummer: yea, the Scripture uſeth to undervalue it more then ſo, and the voice commandeth to cry, Iſa. 40, 6. 7, 8. <hi>All fleſh is graſs, and the goodlineſs thereof as the flower of the field, the one withereth, and the other fadeth, becauſe the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it.</hi> A tree hath ſome ſtability in it, but the flower of the field is but of a moneth or a weeks
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:178706:138"/> ſtanding; Nay, of one days ſtanding, for in the morning the graſs is green, and the Sun ſcorcheth it ere night, ſo that one Sun's courſe ſhall ſee it both growing green and fadeing: So is the goodlineſs, the very perfection, the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence (ſo to ſpeak) and the abſtract of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures perfections: Outward accommodation in a world is as fading a thing as the flower is, as ſmoak is, it is ſo vaniſhing that it bides but a puft of his breath to blow i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to nothing. <hi>Job</hi> hath a ſtrange expreſſion, <hi>Thou looketh upon me, and I am not,</hi> Job 7. 8. The Lord needeth no more but ſtare on the moſt durable creature, and look it not only out of countenance, but alſo look it into its firſt nothing, look it out of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, out of beeing. And therefore you would not truſt in theſe uncertain things, that can take wings and leave you. When you have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation outwardly to your mind, do not build your neſt in it: theſe leaves of proſperity will not cover you alwayes, there is a time when they will fall. Nations have their winter and their ſummer, perſons have them likewiſe, as theſe muſt change in nature, ſo muſt they do in their lot. Heaven only is one day, one Spring perpetually bloſſoming and bringing forth fruit: There is the Tree of Life that bringeth forth fruit every moneth, that hath both Spring and Harveſt all the year over. Chriſtians, ſit not down under the green tree of worldly proſperity: If you do, the leaves will come down about you; The Gourd you truſt in, may be eaten up in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:178706:139"/> been. We deſire you to be armed for changes: Are not matters in the Kingdome ſtill going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout? All things are ſubject to revolution and change, and every year hath its own Summer and Winter, ſo hath it pleaſed the Lord <hi>to ſet the one over againſt the other, that man might find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing after him,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 14. Therefore we would have you caſt your accompts ſo, as the former dayes of darkneſs may return, and the Land be covered with mourning cloaths.</p>
               <p>But would you know what is the original of the creatures vanity, what is the moth that eats up the glory and goodlineſs of creatures enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Here it is, <hi>Sin and iniquities.</hi> It was ſin that firſt ſubjected the Creation to vanity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19, 20. This inferior world was to have been a durable houſe for an immortal ſoul, but ſin made man mortal, and the world corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: And from this proceed all the tempeſts and diſorders that ſeem to be in the Creation. It is this ſtill: It is ſin that raiſeth the ſtorm of the Lords wrath, which bloweth away the wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed leaves of mens enjoyments. Sin drieth up all the ſap and ſweetneſs of the creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, it maketh the leaves of the tree wither, drives the ſap away to the root, hindereth the influence of Gods bleſſing to come thorow the veins of worldly proſperity: For what is the vertue and ſap of Creatures? It is even Gods bleſſing, and therefore the bread nouriſheth not, but the Word and Command of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 4. That is a right unto the Creatures by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, when poſſeſſion of them is entered into by prayer and thankſigiving, for all rightis
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:178706:139"/> ſanctified by theſe, and <hi>it is the iniquities of men, that ſeparateth between God and them, Iſa.</hi> 59. 2. And when God is ſeparated and divided from enjoyments, they muſt needs be empty ſhells and husks, no kernel in them, for <hi>God filleth all in all, is all in all;</hi> And remove him, and you have nothing; your meat and drink is no bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, your table is a ſnare, your pleaſures and laughter have ſadneſs in them, at leaſt they are like the vaniſhing blaze of thorns under a pot. And therefore <hi>when God is angry for ſin, mens beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſumeth as before the moth,</hi> Pſal. 39. 11. When God beginneth to ſhew himſelf terrible, becauſe of ſin, poor man, though of late ſpreading his boughs out, yet all falleth, and like Ice melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as before the Sun, which juſt now ſeemed as ſolid as ſtone. O but <hi>David</hi> was ſenſible of this, and could ſpeak from much experience, Pſal. 32. 3, 4. <hi>The anger of the Lord did eat him up, and dryed his moiſture;</hi> It might be read in his countenance, all the world could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him, all the ſhowres of creatures dropping fatneſs could not keep ſap in him, Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſcorcheth ſo, nay, is within him, that no hiding place is to be found in the world, no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a rock among all the Creatures in ſuch a weary Land. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the people knew this well, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The Lords diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure carried them away, as a floud coming down carrieth all headlong with it, it ſcorched them, and made them wither as graſs. When God ſetteth iniquities before him, that which is the ſouls ſecret, beginneth to imprint it in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible characters on the rod, and writeth his ſin
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:178706:140"/> on his puniſhment, then no wonder that daye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> be ſpent in vanity and grief, ſince they are paſt over in his wrath, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 25. Then doth a ſoul loath its dainty meat, and then doth the Ox lowe over his fodder, meat is laid before, and he cannot touch it, becauſe of the terrours of the Almighty; And that which before he would not once touch, would not enter in terms of communing with, as the Lords threatnings, he muſt now ſit down, and eat them up as his meat; how ſorrowful ſoever, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, when ſin hath prepared a man for judgement, then if iniquity be added to ſin, this raiſeth the ſtorm, and kindleth the fire to conſume the combuſtible matter: when ſin hath given many blowes by preparatory cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections at the root of a mans pleaſure and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, it will at length bring on a fatal ſtroak that ſhall drive the tree to the ground. There are ſome preparatory judgements and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummatory; ſome withers the leaf, and ſome bloweth it quite off. ſome make men like the Harveſt, ripe to put the ſickle of judgement into it. The Corrruption of a land, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of it, and formality in worſhiping of God, ripeneth a land for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But when the wind ariſeth, and iniquities have made it tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous, then who may ſtand, it will ſweep away Nations and people as a flood and make their place not to know them, ſo that there ſhall be neither leaf nor branch left. There is often a
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:178706:140"/> great calm with great provocations, and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cry, <hi>Peace, peace.</hi> But when once the cry of it is gone up to heaven, and hath engaged Gods anger againſt a people or perſon, then it raiſeth a whilr-wind that taketh all away. Now all this belongeth to you, we told you the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of ſin was yours already, and a wonder it is that the complaint is not ours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: Alwayes this ought to be an admonition and example to us on whom the ends of the world are fallen. Therefore we would declare this unto you, that ſin and iniquities have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the taile. Now you ſit at peace, every one in his own dwelling, and ſpread forth your branches. But is there not much uncleanneſs among you? We would have you trouble your carnal peace and ſecurity, trouble your eaſe with thoughts of this. And we have ground to give this warning, becauſe if there were no more but the iniquity of our holy things, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of our ſervice, the commonneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in worſhip, this might be enough to raiſe the ſtorm. You know not for what reaſons to be afraid of judgement, look but on original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, look on the defilement of your religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, and then find ground ſufficient of fading away. Though now you ſit ſtill and ſeem to be ſo ſetled, as you would never be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: you dream of an eternity here, you cleave in your hearts to your houſes and lands: you ſtick as faſt to the world, and will not part with it, as a leaf to a tree: yet behold, the wind of the Lord may ariſe, that ſhall drive you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, take your ſoul from theſe things and then
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:178706:141"/> whoſe ſhall they be? If you will not fear tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral judgements, yet I pray you fear eternal, fear hell. May not the Lord ſhake you off this tree of time, and take you out of the land of the living, to receive your portion. There is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an univerſal deadneſs of ſpirit on the land, but a prophane ſpirit, Iniquities, abominable ſins abound. Every Congregation is overgrown with ſcandals; and for you, None may more juſtly complain: we are all unclean, ſin is not in corners, but men declare their ſin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſin is come to the Maturity, Defection and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy is the temper of all Spirits, and above all the general contempt and ſlighting of this glorious goſpel, is the iniquity of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo that we wonder that the withered leaves yet ſtick to, that the ſtorm is not yet raiſed, and we blown away. Now you are like ſtones, your hearts as Adamants and cannot be moved with his threatnings, the voice of the Lords word doth not once move you: you ſin and are not afraid; Nay, but when Gods anger ſhall joyn with iniquity, and the voice of his rod and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure roar, this ſhall make the mountains to tremble, the rocks to move, and how much more ſhall it drive away a leaf. You ſeem now mountains, but when God ſhall plead, you ſhall be like the chaff driven too and fro. O how eaſy a matter ſhall it be to God to blow a man out of his dwelling place: ſin hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you for it, he needeth no more but blow by his Spirit, or look upon you, and you will not be. You who now are lofty and proud, and maintain your ſelf againſt the word, when you
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:178706:141"/> come to reckon with God, and he entereth in judgement, you ſhall not ſtand: <hi>you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume as before the moth:</hi> your hearts will fail you, <hi>Who may abide the day of his coming?</hi> It will be ſo terrible, and ſo much the more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that you never dreamed of it. If the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this people will not move you, do but caſt your eyes on <hi>Ireland,</hi> who all do fade as a leaf, and their iniquities have taken them away out of their own Land. Shall not the ſeeing of the eye, nor the hearing of the ear teach you? What ſecurity do you promiſe to your ſelves? Have not we ſinned as much as they? Were not they his people as we? Certainly ſince God waiteth longer on you, the ſtroak muſt be the greater: provoked patience muſt turn fury. If you would then prevent this peoples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, go about ſuch a ſerious acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your ſins, <hi>ſearch your wayes and turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the Lord.</hi> And let not every man ſit down in a general notion of ſin, but unbowel it until you ſee uncleanneſs, go up to the fountain head, Original corruption, go down to all the ſtreams, even the iniquity of holy things: let every man be particular in the ſearch of his own provocations perſonal, and every one be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in the general ſins of the Land, that you may confeſſe out of knowledge and ſenſe, <hi>we are all unclean,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Iſai. 64. 7.</bibl>
                  <q>
                     <hi>And there is none that calleth upon thy Name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of thee,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THey go on in the Confeſſion of their ſins: Many a man hath ſoon done with that: A general notion of ſin, is the higheſt advancement in repentance that many attain to. You may ſee here, Sin and Judgement mixed in thorow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their complaint: They do not ſo fix their eyes upon their deſolat eſtate of captivity, as to forget their provocations. Many a man would ſpend more affection, and be more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick in the expreſſion of his miſery when it is pungent, nor he can do when he ſpeaketh of his ſins. We would obſerve from the nature of this confeſſion ſomething to be a patern of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And it is this. When the ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth, and men are ſerious in repentance, then the ſoul is more ſearching, more univerſal, more particular in acknowledgement of ſins. Theſe are characters of the Spirits work. Firſt, The Spirit diſcovereth unto men, not only ſin but the loathſomeneſs of ſin, its hainous nature, how offenſive it is to Gods holy eye; Many of you know abundance of evil deeds, and call them
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:178706:142"/> ſins, but you have never taken up ſins ugly face, never ſeen it in the glaſſe of the holy Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe it ſelf, becauſe you do not abhore your ſelves; poor and low thoughts of God maketh mean and ſhallow thoughts of ſin. You would be as Job <hi>vile</hi> ch. 40. 4. And <hi>abhore your ſelves in duſt and aſhes,</hi> ch. 42. 6. As Gods holineſs grew great in your eyes, Sins uncleanneſs would grow proportionably Iſ. 6. 3. 5. And here your repentance halteth in the very entry.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, The Spirit diſcovereth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the uncleanneſs of mens natures, and leadeth them up to original corruption, but the Spirit alſo leadeth men alongs all the ſtreams, not only theſe that break out, but thoſe who go under ground, and have a more ſecret and ſubtil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance: It concludeth not only open breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the command under filthineſs, but alſo all a mans own righteouſneſs, though never ſo refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it concludeth it alſo a defiled garment, ſo that the Soul can look no where but ſee ſin, and uncleanneſs in its ornaments and duties. And thus it appeareth before God without ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, openeth up its Soul, hideth not ſin with the covering of duties, but ſeeth a neceſſity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother covering for all. Now therefore let the moſt part of you conclude that you have never yet gotteh your eyes open to ſee ſin or confeſſe it, becauſe when you ſit down to compt your ſins, there are many things that you call not ſin, you uſe not to reckon your praying and repentance among ſins: Nay, becauſe you have ſo much confidence in your repentance and confeſſion, you have never repented: you muſt ſee a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:178706:143"/> of a covering of Chriſts righteouſneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all; Faith in Jeſus muſt cover repentance and it ſelf both, with the glorious object of it. But alas how ſoon are many at an end of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſome particular groſſe actions may come in remembrance, but no more. Sum up al your confeſſions, they have never yet pitched on the thouſand part of your guiltineſs, no not in kinds, let be in number.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, The Spirit convinceth ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly both, it convinceth of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſins, as we ſaid laſt, of the iniquity of holy things, and eſpecially of the moſt ſubſtantial duties faith and prayer. <hi>John</hi> 16. 8, 9. there are not many of you have come this length to ſee your want of prayer. No, your own words do witneſs againſt you, for you uſe to ſay, I pray day and night, I believe in God with all my heart. Now therefore out of your own mouth ſhall you be condemned, when the ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth you of Sin, you will ſee no faith, no prayer at the firſt opening of the eyes. But I add, there is no true confeſſion but it is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the Spirit uſeth not to be wilder mens ſpirits in a general notion only, and a wild field of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſins: And ſuch are many of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions: You mourn for ſin (as you ſay) and yet you cannot condeſcend on a particular that burdeneth your conſcience; you grant you have many ſins, but ſit down to compt them, and there is a ſhort compt of them, Now do you not reflect back upon former humiliations in publick, and former acknowledgements of ſins in private? do you not yet return upon your
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:178706:143"/> own hearts to lay home this ſad challenge. I have never repented, I do not yet repent: muſt not all your ſolemn approaches be iniquity, and abomination, while your ſouls are not afflicted for ſin, while you can ſee ſo few ſins &amp;c. The faſting dayes of <hi>Scotland</hi> will be numbered in the roll of greateſt provocations, becauſe there is no real and ſpiritual conviction of ſin among us: Cuſtom now hath taken away the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and there remaineth nothing but the very name. Is this the faſt that the Lord chooſeth? No, believe it, this ſhall add to your provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and rather haſten lingering judgement, then keep it off, we would beſeech you this day, pray for pardon of former abuſed faſts. If you had no more to mourn for, this might ſpend the day and our ſpirits both, and exhauſt all our preſent ſupplications, even the wall of partition that ſtands between God and Scotland, which all our former ſolemn humiliations hath built up, a great deal higher then other ſins could reach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy Name,]</hi> Did not this people make many prayers, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. 15. before the captivity? And did they not cry, which noteth ſome fervency in it? And faſt a little before it in <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> time, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 11. and 14. 12. in the time of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>Mic.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Zech</hi> 7. 3. How then is it that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet now on the watch-tower looking round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him to take up the peoples condition, and being led by the Spirit ſo far as to the caſe of the captives in <hi>Babel,</hi> can find no prayer, no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? And was not <hi>Daniel</hi> ſo too, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 13. Lo, then here is the conſtruction that the Spirit
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:178706:144"/> of God putteth on many prayers and faſtings in a Land, <hi>There is none calleth on thy Name;</hi> there is none that prayeth faithfully and fervently, few to count upon that prayeth any. It may be there are many publick prayers, but who prayeth in ſecret, and mourneth to God alone? There are many prayers, but the inſcription is, <hi>To the unknown God,</hi> to a nameleſs God, your praying is not a calling on his Name as a known God and revealed in the Word.</p>
               <p>This then we would ſay unto you, that there may be many prayers in your account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and none in Gods. There are many prayers of men that God counteth no more of, then the howling of a dog. Firſt, The cry of mens practices is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten louder then their prayers, and goeth up to Heaven, that the cry of prayer cannot be heard. When mens converſation is flat contrary to their ſupplications, ſupplication is no calling on his Name, but charming rather. <hi>Sodoms</hi> abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations had a cry up to God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 21. So <hi>Ahels</hi> blood had a cry for vengeance, which <hi>Cains</hi> prayers could not out-cry. Thus the Lord would not hear many prayers <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 15. becauſe hands and practices were polluted: you that know no worſhip of God, but in ſuch a ſolemn duty; your religion is ſummed up and confined, within the limits of Temple-worſhip, Family exerciſe and prayer; Certainly the reſt of your converſation muſt ſpeak more: God will not heat but ſuch as worſhip him and do his will. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 31. Your prayer is a dark parable, if your converſation expone it not. This I ſpeak for this end, to put many of you out of your
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:178706:144"/> falſe ground of Confidence: you have nothing but your prayers to truſt unto, And for your converſation, you never go about it effectually to reform it but goeth on in that which you pray againſt: we declare unto you the truth your prayers are Abomination <hi>Pro.</hi> 28. 9. The wicked may have prayers, And therefore think not to pleaſe God and flatter him with your mouths, when your converſation is rebellion: ſince you hear not him in his commands, God will not hear you in your petitions <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 24. 28. You ſtopped your ear at his reproof, God will ſtop his ear at your requeſt. If you will go to heaven by your own righteouſneſs, I pray you, follow more after it, make the garment more to cover your nakedneſs: the skirt of a duty is not ſufficient.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When iniquity is regarded in the heart, (and idols ſet up in Gods place,) God will not own ſuch a worſhip, but ſendeth a man to the Idols he ſerveth <hi>Pſa.</hi> 66. 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 3. 4. Do you not often pray to God againſt a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when your heart cleaveth unto it, and what your mouth ſaith, your heart contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth? Light and Conſcience often extort a confeſſion of beloved ſins, while the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the heart hath this language, Lord grant not my requeſt. And therefore if there be a prayer for pardon of guilt, yet there is no through reſolution to quite the ſin; And as long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> a ſoul is not reſolved to quite the ſin, there can be no ingenuous confeſſion of it, and no prayer for removing the guilt can be heard, You cannot imploy Chriſt in his office of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorſhip
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:178706:145"/> as a Prieſt to interceed and offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſin, unleſſe you as ſincerely imploy him as a ſanctifier and Redeemer. And therefore prayer that ſeparateth Chriſts offices, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not on whole Chriſt calleth not on his name, for his name is <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> How can the Lord be inquired of by ſuch a one who cometh to mock him, puteth up an Idol in the heart, and yet prayeth againſt it, or ſome other ſin, while he is not reſolved to quite it. Shall God be reſolute to help, when we are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> earneſt in ſeeking it. No wonder God anſwer you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Idol: No wonder you be given up to ſerve Idols, and your ſin grow upon you as a plague for your hypocriſy, when you ingadge your heart too much to any creature and comes to pray and inquire of the Lord in your neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhall it not be righteouſneſs with him, to ſend you to your God <hi>when thou cryeſt let thy companies deliver thee,</hi> Iſa. 57. 13. O man cry unto thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome idol, and let it help thee, ſince thou truſteſt to it and ſpendeth thy heart on it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 37, 38. <hi>Where is the God that drunk the Wine of your offerings, and eat the fat of your ſacrifices?</hi> where is the creature that you have made your heart an altar to, to ſend up the flames of your choiceſt thoughts and affections to it? let this riſe up, and help you now, ſaith the Lord. Therefore we exhort you, if you would have your prayers a delight, be upright in the thing you ſeek, and ſee that you intertain no known ſin, give it no heart allowance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are many prayers not heard, not known, becauſe the mouth outcryeth the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:178706:145"/> heart. It is the ſacrifice of the contrite heart that God deſpiſeth not. The prayers of this people were ſuch, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29. 13. <hi>They drew near with the mouth, but the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t was far away.</hi> It is worſhip in ſpirit and truth that God loveth, <hi>Joh</hi> 4. 23. Since Prayer is a communion of God with the Creature, a meeting of one with God, and ſpeaking face to face; God who is a Spirit and immortal, muſt have a ſpirit to meet with, a ſoul to ſpeak to him. Now do you not find your hearts gading abroad even in duty? Is it not moſt about your Corns and Lands in the time of ſolemn worſhip? Therefore God getteth no more but a carcaſſe to keep communion with; He may have as much fellowſhip with the ſtones of the wall, and timber of the houſe, as he can have with your ears and mouths, while you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move your hearts to attend other things. And I would ſay more, if your mind be preſent, yet your heart is gone, ſometimes, yea often, both are gone abroad: Sometimes the mind and thought ſtayeth, but the affection and heart is not with it, and ſo the minds reſidence is not conſtant: Your thought may come in as a way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring man, but tarrieth not all night, dwelleth not. Now ſpeak to it, even Chriſtians, may not your Prayers often have a contrary interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to what they pretend? You pray ſo coldrifely and formally, as God will interpret, you have no mind to it: we ask as we ſeemed indifferent whether our petition be granted or not. Should the Lord be affected with your petitions, when you your ſelves are not affected much? Should his bowels of zeal ſound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:178706:146"/> him, when yours are ſilent? <hi>It is fervent prayer availeth much,</hi> Iſai. 5. 16. A heart ſent out with the petition, and gone up to Heaven, cannot but bring back an anſwer. If Prayer carry not the ſeal of the heart and ſoul in it, God cannot own it, or ſend it back with his ſeal of acceptation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Many Prayers are not <hi>calling on Gods Name:</hi> And no wonder that when people pray, yet the Spirit ſay, <hi>None calleth on thy Name,</hi> for Prayer is made, as to an unknown God, and God is not taken up according to his <hi>Name,</hi> which are his glorious Attributes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he manifeſteth himſelf in his Word. To <hi>call on Gods Name,</hi> is ſo to pray to God, as to take him up, as he hath revealed himſelf. And what is the Lords Name? Hear himſelf ſpeak to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 33. 19. and 34. 6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, and tranſgreſſion, and ſin, and that will by no means clear the guilty.</hi> Now to call on this Name, is for the ſoul in Prayer, to have a ſuitable ſtamp on it: every Attribute of God taking deep impreſſion in the heart. And ſo Gods Name to be written on the very petitions: And ſhortly, we may ſay, the Spirit ſhould have the impreſſion of Gods great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and Majeſty, of his goodneſſe and mercy, of his terribleneſſe and juſtice. This is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God proclaimeth his Name into. In the entry the ſupplicant ſhould behold the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soveraignty and infinite diſtance between God and the Creature, that he may have the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:178706:146"/> ſtamp of reverence and abaſement upon his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and may ſpeak out of the duſt, as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the duſt of the ballance and footſtool to do to him, who ſitteth on the circle of the Heaven as his Throne. And this I muſt ſay, there is little Religion and Godlineſſe among us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every man is ignorant of God. Even Gods children do more ſtudy themſelves, and their condition, then Gods greatneſſe and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Who ſearches Gods infinitneſſe in his Word and Works till he behold a wonder, and be drowned in a myſtery? O but the Saints of old did take up God at a greater diſtance from the Creatures, they waded far into this bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Ocean of Gods Majeſty, till they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver head and ears, and wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But withal you muſt ſtudy his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy, and this maketh up the moſt part of his Name; The definition of God hath moſt of this, ſo that it may be ſaid truly, that mercy is his delight, mercy as it were, ſwelleth over the reſt: God were not acceſſible, unleſſe mercy did temper it. Behold then greatneſſe to humble, and goodneſs to make bold, that you may have acceſſe. As greatneſs ſhould leave the ſtamp of reverence on your petitions, ſo ſhould mercy and goodneſſe imprint them with faith and confidence; And that the rather becauſe

                  <hi>prayer.</hi> I was all prayer. It was my Work, my Element, my Affection, my Action. Nay, to ſpeak the truth, it is the decay of prayer that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:178706:150"/> hath made all this defection in the Land. Would you know the original of many a publick mans Apoſtacy and backſliding in the cauſe of God, what maketh them ſo ſoon forget their ſolemn ingagements, and grow particular, ſeeking their own things, untender in ſeeking the things of God? Would you trace back the Deſertion up to the Fountain head? Then come and ſee. Look upon ſuch a mans walking with God in private, ſuch a mans praying, and you ſhall find matters have been firſt wrong there. Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and eſtrangement from God himſelf in immediat Duties, and ſecret approaches, hath made m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns Affections cooll to his intereſt in publick Duties. And believe it, the reaſon why ſo few great men, or none are ſo cordial, conſtant and through in Gods Matters, is this, they pray not in ſecret; They come to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Council, where publick Matters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Honour of God, are to be debated, as any Staſ-man of <hi>Venice,</hi> would come to the Senate. They have no dependence on God to be guided in theſe Matters; They are much in publick Duties, but little in ſecret with God. Believe it, any mans private walking with God, ſhall be read upon his publick carriage, whither he be Miniſter or Ruler.</p>
               <p>There is yet another thing we would have you conſider, to endear this Duty unto you, and bind upon your Conſciences, an abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of being much in it, and it is this. Prayer and calling on his Name is often put for all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat Worſhip of God, eſpecially, the more ſubſtantial and moral part of Service. This
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:178706:151"/> people was much in Ceremonials, and they made theſe their righteouſneſs. Nay, but there was little ſecret converſing with God, walking humbly with him, loving him, believing in him. Well then, prayer is, as it were, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and ſumm of all Duties. It contains in it, Faith, Love, Repentance, all theſe ſhould breath out in prayer. In a word, if we ſay to you, be much in prayer, we have ſaid all, and it is more then all the reſt, becauſe it is a more near and immediat approach to God; having more ſolid Religion in it. If you be lively in this, you are thriving Chriſtians; if you wither here, all muſt decay, for prayer ſappeth and watereth all othes Duties with the influence of Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold on thee]</hi> This expreſſeth more of their condition under the Rod, and while God was threatning to depart and leave them, none took ſo much notice of it, as to awake out of his dream, to take a faſt hold of God. It was but like the grip a man taketh in his ſlumbering, that he ſoon quiteth in his ſleep. None awaketh himſelf, as a bird ſtirreth up it ſelf with its wings to flight: None do ſo ſpread out their ſails to meet the wind: This importeth a great ſecurity and negligence, a careleſs ſtupidity. To take hold, to grip ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and violently, importeth both Faith acted on God, and Communion with God, ſo that the ſenſe is, no body careth, whither thou go, there is none that ſtirreth up himſelf to take violent hold of thee; Men ly louſe in their intereſt, and indifferent in the one thing neceſſary, do not ſtrongly grip to it. No body keepeth thee by
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:178706:151"/> prayer and interceſſion, ſo that there is no dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence added to diligence, there is no ſtirring up of our ſelves in ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when the Lord ſeemeth to withdraw, and when he is angry, it is our duty, to take hold the more on him, and not only to act Faith, and call on him by prayer, but to add to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diligence, it ſhould be extraordinary. Firſt then, I ſay, when the Lord is withdrawing and ſeemeth angry, we ought not to withdraw from him by unbelief, but to draw near, and take hold on him. And the Lord giveth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this himſelf, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. <hi>becauſe fury is not in me.</hi> It is but a moments anger, it is not hatred of your perſons but ſins, it is not fury that hath no diſcretion in it, to difference between a friend and an enemy: It is but at leaſt a fathers anger, that is not for deſtruction, but correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Lord is not implacable, come to him and win him, <hi>let bim take hold of me, and let him make peace with me, if he will make peace.</hi> He is a God whoſe compaſſions fail not; and ſo he is never ſo angry, but there is room left for mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Mercy on thoſe that come to him. Gods anger is not an humor and paſſion as ours is, he can take the poor Child in his Armes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it into his boſome, when outward Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations frown. Mens anger is like the ſons of <hi>Belial,</hi> Briers and Thornes that none may come near to, leſt they be hurt, but God angry is acceſſible, becauſe his anger is ſtill tempered and mixed with Clemency and Mercy, and that mixture of Mercy is ſo great, and ſo predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in all his Diſpenſations here, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:178706:152"/> rightly underſtood, might rather invite to come, then ſcarre from it, there is more Mercy to welcome, then Anger to drive away.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Look upon the very end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Gods hiding himſelf, and withdrawing, it is this; that we may come and ſeek him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 15 When God is angry, Mercy and Compaſſion principleth it, for anger is ſent out to bring in wanderers: His anger is not humor, but reſolute and deliberate, walketh u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon good grounds. Becauſe <hi>David</hi> in his proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity miſſed not God. When all things went according to his minde, then he let God go where he will. Therefore, the Lord in mercy muſt hide his own Heart with a frowning coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and cover himſelf with a Cloud, that <hi>David</hi> may be troubled, and ſo take hold on God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 7, 8. Since then, this is Gods purpoſe, that you may come nearer to him, and ſince he goeth away that you may purſue, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he will never ſo run away as you may not find him out, nor will he run further, nor he ſtrengtheneth thee to purſue him; Thus, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 63. 8. God was flying, and <hi>David</hi> purſuing; Nay, but the flyer giveth leggs to the purſuer, he upholdeth him, as it were againſt himſelf. So did the Angel ſtrengthen <hi>Jacob</hi> to overcome himſelf. Now ſhall it not be pleaſant to God, that you lay hold on him as your own, even when he ſeemeth to be cloathed with venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſeing he changeth his outward Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for this very end, he ſeemeth to go, that you may hold, becauſe when you think he ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, you hold not, as the Child, while the nurſe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:178706:152"/> is near, will look about it, and take hold of any thing, but when ſhe withdraweth, the Child cleaveth the faſter to her.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, we ought to ſtirre up our ſelves more now, then any other time: Times of Gods withdrawing, calleth for extraordinary and doubled approaches. So <hi>Hab.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>they will ſeek me early.</hi> And therefore the Lords Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Scripture, have made great advantage of ſuch Diſpenſations. The truth is, as long as we are well dealt with, ſecurity creepeth on, and Religion is but in a decaying condition: Duties are done through our ſleep: We are not as men awaking and knowing what we do, and whither we go. But when the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to trouble us, and hides his Face, then it is a time to awake out of ſleep, before all be gone: And there ought to be firſt, more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in Duties and approaching to God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your caſe furniſheth more matter of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; And as matter of ſupplication grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, prayer ſhould grow. If neceſſity grow, and the cry be not according to neceſſity, it is ominous. And therefore <hi>David</hi> uſeth to make his cry go up according to his trouble. In a proſperous Condition, though every thing might call a tender hearted loving Chriſtian to ſome nearneſs to God; yet ordinarly, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity preſſe not, prayer languiſheth, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth formal. Senſe of need putteth an edge on ſupplication, wheras proſperity blunteth it. The heart miſſing nothing, cannot go above ſublunary things; but let it not have its will here, and the need of Heaven will be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:178706:153"/> Now I ſay, if you ſit ſo many calls, both from a Command, and from your own neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, you do ſo much the more ſin. <hi>Affliction will make even a hypocrite ſeek him, and pour out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> prayer and viſit him,</hi> Pſal. 78. And <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26. And if you do not take advantage of all theſe preſſures, you muſt be ſo much the more guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And therefore, God as it were, wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at their obſtinacy, <hi>They return not to him that ſmiteth them:</hi> All this is come upon us, yet have we not prayed. And ſecondly, it is ſent for that end, that you may be more ſerious, and therefore you ought ſo much the more to awake, to lay hold on him. This is the way the Lord uſeth with his ſecure and wandering Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 67. For the Lord findeth us often gripping too ſtrongly to a preſent world; and taking it in our armes, as if we were never to part with it: Mens ſouls cleave to outward accomodations. Therefore the Lord uſeth to part us and our idol, that we may take hold of him the faſter. It is Union with himſelf, that is our felicity, and it is that which God moſt endeavoureth. When he removeth beloved Jewels, it is becauſe they were a ſtumbling block, and divorced the Soul from God: When he ſeemeth to withdraw himſelf, his going pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth ſo much, Oh follow or periſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is a very dangerous thing, when he withdraweth and you follow not, when he is angry, and you care not, doth not fly in to make peace with him, certainly his anger muſt wax hotter, and deſertion will become a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual plague, Rods muſt be tempered with much
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:178706:153"/> bitterneſs. What mixture of Mercy can be in ſuch a Diſpenſation, where the fruit of it is to harden. But if the Lords hardeſt dealing wrought you to more nearneſs and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with himſelf, then certainly you have a fair advantage againſt the preſent trouble, and you have your Cup mixed. You ſhall at length bleſſe God for ſuch Diſpenſations, they may be reckoned for good to you. Next, there ought to be more exerciſe of Faith, and laying hold on the grounds of Conſolation in God, in ſuch a time. 1. For as difficulties grow, Faith ſhould fortify it ſelf againſt them ſo much the more. The greater the ſtorm be, it ſhould fly the more into the Chalmbers. Faith in the time of a calme day getteth no tryal; Faith bulketh much, becauſe it hath not much to do. But except there be ſome freſh and new ſupplies, it cannot hold out in a temptation: But it is a ſingular proof of a Noble and Divine Faith, that can lay hold on him, and keep him, when he would go, that can challenge kindneſs on a miskening Jeſus, that can ſtand on the ground of the Promiſes, when there is not a foot breadth of a Diſpenſation to build on: While all things go with you, ye have no difficulty to maintain your Faith; Nay, but when the Lord ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to look angry, then awake and gather ſtrength, take hold on his ſtrength; Look what is in your Condition, or his Diſpenſation, what is good or omnious, then take hold on the other hand on him, and look what is in him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it, and ſwallow it up: Ye ought to be well acquaint with the grounds of Conſolation
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:178706:154"/> that are in God, in the worſt caſe, and then ye might lay hold on him, though he ſeemed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire. It is then a time that calleth moſt for ſecureing your intereſt in him, a time when there is no external advantage to beguile you, a time when the only happineſs is to be one with God. Therefore, the man who in ſuch Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Judgements, is not a waked to put his eternal Eſtate out of queſtion, he is in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous caſe: For do not moſt part drive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their dayes, and have no aſſurance of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they dare not ſay, either pro, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra. It may be, and it may not be. And this is the length that the moſt part come, a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Peace; No poſitive Confidence. No clear concluding on ſure grounds an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Alwayes ye are moſt called to this, when God afflicteth the Land, or you: If ye do not then make Peace, it is moſt dangerous. 3. The Lord loveth Faith in a difficulty beſt, it is the ſingleſt and the cleanlieſt, it is that which moſt honoureth him, and glorifieth his Truth and Faithfulneſſe, and Sufficiency and Mercy; for then it is moſt purely Elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above Creatures, and pitcheth moſt on God; And therefore bringeth men to this, <hi>No help for my ſoul, but thou art my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And this commendeth God moſt; when he is ſet alone. Proſperity bringeth him down among Creatures, and ſecure Faith, maketh little diſtinction; But awakening Faith grippeth ſtrongly and ſingly, puteth God alone:</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:178706:154"/>
               <p> Secondly, Oftentimes, when God is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, none ſtirreth up himſelf to lay hold on him: Although there may be praying and doing of many duties, yet there is nothing beyond ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. The varieties and acceſſions of new grounds of ſupplications doth neither make greater frequency, nor more fervency. This our experience may clear unto us both in duties and faith. Firſt, There is very little diligence in ſeeking of God in the way and means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even when God ſeemeth to bid farewel to the Land and go away: No body cometh in as an interceſſor. Men keep on their old way of praying, and never addeth to it, come what like. Who is it that riſeth above his ordinary as the Tide of Gods diſpenſation is? There ought to be ſuch an impreſſion made by the changes of Gods countenance, as might be read on the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his people. There ſhould be ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between your ordinary and ſuch times, as between a ſleeping man and a waking man, that whatever your attainment of acceſs to God be, ye might ſtir up and go beyond it, according as matters call. Will God count your publick Faſts a performance of this duty? Alas, we faſt ſleeping, and none ſtirreth up himſelf to theſe things. Is there any difference betwixt your ſolemn Humiliation and another Sabbath? And is there any difference between a Sabbath and a week day, ſave the external duty? Is not this palpably our caſe? Is there any wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening among us? No, ſecurity is both the univerſal diſeaſe and complaint; And it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an incurable diſeaſe, ſince it became a
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:178706:155"/> complaint. Doth any of you pray more in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate then ye uſed? Or what edge is on your prayers? Alas, the Lord will get good leave to go from us; It feareth me, that we would give Chriſt a Teſtimonial to go over Seas. <hi>Hold him, hold him.</hi> Nay, the multitude would be gladly quite of him, they cannot abide his yoke, his work is a burden, his word is a torment, his diſcipline is bands and cords; And what heart can ye then have to keep Chriſt? What vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence can ye offer to him to hold him ſtill? All your intreaties may be fair complements, but they would never rent his garment. Secondly, There is no up-ſtirring to faith among us, and laying hold on Jeſus Chriſt, albeit all his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations warn us that it is now high time. There are not many who are about this point effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to ſtir up their faith, or to ſecure their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Think ye that conjectures will carry you thorow difficulties. The multitude think they believe much, but any temptation proveth their miſtake. The moſt part of <hi>Scotland</hi> would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, if they were put to it. Alwayes it is a time ye would not ly out from your ſtrong hold faith only uniteth you to Chriſt, and if ye would be kept in any trial ſtir up fait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Prayer and Faith, diligence and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold on God muſt go together, and help one another. Not calling on his Name, and not laying hold on him go together, and have influence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e upon another. Firſt, Faith hath influence on Prayer. Laying hold on God in Chriſt, will make right calling on his Name,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:178706:155"/> it learneth men how to call God, to call him <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> Faith uſeth to vent i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it, and alſo make much prayer: for when a ſoul hath pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on God, as its only felicity, and thus made choice of him, it findeth in him all-ſufficiency, all things for all things; There is no neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, but it findeth a ſupply in his fulneſs for it; And therefore it applyeth a man to the fountain, <hi>to draw out of the wells of ſalvation.</hi> There is nothing can be ſo ſweet and refreſhing, as for ſuch a ſoul to pour out it ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lf every day in him, to talk with him face to face. Faith ingageth the heart to come to God with all things; whereas many difficulties would have been, and the ſecure or unſettled heart would have gone as many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent wayes to help them: Faith laying hold on God, knoweth but one, and bringeth all here. And therefore acceſs to God is a fruit of it, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs unto the grace wherein we ſtand by faith,</hi> And again, how can Prayer be acceptable, as long as Faith doth not principle it; It is but like a beaſts groaning under a burden. Laying hold on God himſelf makes a mans duties acceptable, becauſe he ſpeaks and asks, believing that he ſhall receive, he truſteth God, and doth not tempt him. Where lively faith is not intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there cannot be much affection, which is the oyl of the wheels. There may be in ſome bitterneſs of ſpirit much vehemency, but that is
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:178706:156"/> not a pure flame of divine love that burneth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to him, and it is ſoon extinguiſhed, and laſteth no longer nor preſent ſenſe, and then the ſoul groweth harder, as iron that had been in the fire. Secondly, when there is not much prayer and calling, faith cannot be ſtrong and violent; for prayer is even the exerciſe of faith, if you wear out of that, faith ruſteth. There may be much quietneſs with little prayer, but there cannot be much and ſtrong and lively faith; for where it getteth not continual imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it faggs. And indeed prayer is a ſpecial point of holding God faſt, and keeping him, Therefore joyn theſe, if ye would thrive in any one of them. Your unbelieving complaints are not prayers and calling on his Name, becauſe they are not mixed with faith. As the Apoſtle ſaid of the Word, ſo may it be ſaid of Prayer, your prayers are not profitable, are not heard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe not mixed with faith. Ye uſe to doubt that ye may be fervent, to queſtion your intereſt, that ye may ſtir up your ſpirits to prayer: But alas, what a ſimple groſſe miſtake is that? Poor ſoul, though thou get more liberty, ſhall it be counted acceſs to God? Though you have more grief, and your bitterneſs doth indite more eloquence, ſhall God be moved with it? Know ye not that you ſhould ask without wavering, and lift up pure hands without wrath and doubting? and yet both are there.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The duty we are called to in ſuch a time when God is angry, is to lay hold on him. We would ſpeak a word more of it: And firſt, we ought to hold a departing Lord, by wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:178706:156"/> with him in ſupplication, <hi>not to let bim de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part till he bleſs, Hoſ.</hi> 12. 3, 4. The applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jacobs</hi> victory over the Angel is thus, <hi>Turn ye to the Lord, and wait on him,</hi> &amp;c. How had <hi>Jacob</hi> power over the Angel? By ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and weeping. So that prayer is a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over God, even the Lord God of Hoſts. We ought (as it were) to ſtrive againſt outward diſpenſation; when it ſaith, He is gone, when our condition ſaith, He is gone, or going, we ought to wreſtle with it: No ſubmiſſion to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, I mean, no ſubmiſſion that ſitteth down with it, and is not careful how it be. Now this time calleth you to ſuch an exerciſe. The Lord ſeemeth to be angry with us, there is a ſtrong cloud over the Land, and like to pour down upon us, the Lord is drawing a ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and beginning now to lay on: Many threatnings would not put us to ſupplication; Now what will the laying on of the rod do? If the former dayes be returning wherein ye ſaw much ſorrow, Is it not then high time for the Lords remembrancers, and for the Lords chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to wreſtle with God. As <hi>Eſau</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſo hath God armed men, and ſuch deſperate men, as he hath made a rod to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If we be twice beaten with it, it is very juſt, for before we did not ſeek in to him who ſmote us. You would know this, that the Lord is but ſeeking imployment, and if ye would deal with him, ye may make advantage of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future calamities. And look to this laying hold on him: This is the chief thing ye ſhould now heed. It is God himſelf that ſhould
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:178706:157"/> be your principal object. Praying ſhould be a laying hold on God, it ſhould meet with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For the moſt part in the time of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we cannot meet with God ſinglely, we have ſo much to do with creatures, we keep tryſts ſo punctually with them, ſo that we cannot keep with God:: We have ſo many things in our affections and thoughts, that God cannot get place, he cannot get us at leiſure for the throng of our buſineſs: we loſs God by catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſhadows. Well then, we are called in ſuch a time of difficulty to come in to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. to draw by the vail of Ordinances, that we may have Communion with God himſelf. And this is right praying when the ſoul getteth ſuch immediate acceſs to God, as it were, to handle him, and ſee him, and taſte him, to exerciſe its ſenſes on him. Ordinances have been of a long time a covering of his face, and he uſeth not now to unvail himſelf in the Sanctuary, and let us ſee his glory: God is departed from preaching and praying, and the ſolemn meeting, ſo that we meet not with God, we lay hold on a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of an outward Ordinance but not on God himſelf. Therefore Chriſtians make advantage of this time, you may be brought to want Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, then lay hold on himſelf, who is the ſubſtance and marrow of them: you may be denuded of outward comforts and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, then lay hold on himſelf in much prayer. If affliction would blow away the cloud on his face, or would ſcatter our idols from us, and make us ſingle alone with God, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was, it were well ſent.</p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:178706:157"/>
               <p> Secondly, Your exerciſe ſhould be to take hold on God by faith. And firſt ye would make peace with God, be much in direct acts of apprehending God himſelf in Jeſus Chriſt. And this is according as ye take up your ſelves in your own miſery and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſity. Do but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel continually between your own miſery and ſomething anſwerable in God.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing we would have you do now when God frowns upon us, find out your own loſt condition, and how great ſtrangers you have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n to him, even when ye have app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oached in many O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dinances: And find a neceſſity of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace with God and atonement. Now from this, lay hold on Chriſt as <hi>the hope ſet before you,</hi> look upon that in him which will anſwer all your nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſities, and be ſuitable to them. It is not matters of outward lot that ſhould go near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt your heart: Let the world go where it will, that which concerneth you moſt in ſuch a time, is the ſecuring your ſoul: for if ye loſs it what gain you? What keep you? Your houſes and lands and lives may be in hazard: Nay, but one thing is more worth then all theſe, and in more hazard. Begin at ſpiritual things, and ask how matters ſtand between God and thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Not only would ye be much in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat application unto Jeſus Chriſt, but ye would ſo take hold of him, as ye may be ſure ye have him. Make peace, and know that ye have made it, and then ſhall ye be kept in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace. You would never reſt until you can on ſolid grounds anſwer the queſtion. And this duty is called for from you at ſuch a time,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:178706:158"/> for <hi>the juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> in a troubleſome time, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. And as ye ought to keep and hold faſt confidence, and not caſt it away in ſuch a time, ſo ſhould ye all ſeek after it: Do not only reſt in this, I know not but I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt, I dar not ſay againſt it. O no Chriſtians, you ſhould have poſitive clear grounds of aſſurance. <hi>I am his, and he is mine. I know that my Redeemer liveth. God is my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And if ye conclude this ſolidly, I defy all the world to ſhake and trouble your peace: this is perfect peace, <hi>peace, peace,</hi> double peace. How can you chooſe but be ſhaken at every blaſt of temptation, when you are not thus ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly grounded, when you hold not at your Anchor.</p>
               <p>And Thirdly, Having thus laid hold on Chriſt, as your own, lay hold on all in him as yours, and for your uſe. Whatever difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the preſent time, or your own condition af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, ſearch but as much in God, as may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terballance it. Anſwer all objections, from his Mercy, Goodneſſe, Power, Wiſdom, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changableneſs: And this ſhall be more nor the trouble: God himſelf laid hold upon, and made ours, is more nor removing a temporal Calamitv. It is an eternal weight, to weigh down all Croſſes and Diſapointments. For what can preſent things be? Is there not in the favour of his countenance, that which may drown them in Oblivion? Are ye like to ſink here? Is not God a ſure Anchor to hold by? And if you do not this, your trouble is nothing in reſpect of the danger of your Soul, Secure
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:178706:158"/> and looſe lying out of God, not putting this matter to a full poynt, is worſe nor all your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fading. Therefore we exhort you in the Lords Name, to fly in to this Name of the Lord, as a ſtrong tower to run to and be ſafe. When the Lord ſeemeth now to be angry with us, run not away from him, though he ſhould yet cloath himſelf with vengeance as a Garment.</p>
               <p>But Firſt, O ye poor people who have never asked this Queſtion, whether have I any Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Jeſus? Ask it now, and reſolve it in time. If trouble come on, if ſcattering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation come on, and our Land fade as a Leaf, certainly the Lords anger will drive you away. What will ye do in the time of his Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? All of you put this to the tryal, how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtand between God and you?</p>
               <p>And Secondly, if ye find all wrong, do not ſink in diſcouragement; All may be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while it is ſeen wrong in time. Nay, God taketh away outward Accomodation, to make you more ſerious in this. And it is the very voice of Rods, every one fly in to your hold, every one make peace with me. You may take hold and do it feckfully.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, You who have fled to Jeſus, take more hold of him, you are called alſo to renew your Faith, and begin again: Make peace with God, let your confidence be kept faſt, and thus ſhall ye be immoveable, becauſe he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not. God will not go from you if ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, hold him by Faith. Chriſt could not do great things in <hi>Galilee, becauſe of their unbelief, and ſo be departed from them.</hi> As unbelief mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

               <p>Fourthly, Faith and Prayer, or holding o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We can behold, or hear of our neighbours ſpoyling, and violence done to them, but till the voice of a cry be heard in our own Streets and Fields, no body will take the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to themſelves. It is well ſaid, that which is ſpoken to all, is ſpoken to none, ſo what is done to all in generall, is done to hone. The voice of a general Rod, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not particularly, and maketh not men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of ſad things, and thus men are not preſſed unto prayer, are not put out of themſelves; It is onely neceſſity that ſapps the roots of it, and makes it green.

There is no Duty that needeth ſo ſpiritual and lively Principles. If a man do not put on ſuch a peece of reſolution and edge upon him, he cannot come to the wreſtling of Prayer, and violence of Faith. Although the exerciſe and acting of Grace dependeth more upon the Spirit of God, his preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, then upon the Soul of man, yet this is the way the Lord communicateth his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, by ſtirring up and exciting the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to its duty, as if it could do it alone.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do exhort you firſt, to purpoſe this as your end to aim at, and purpoſe by Gods Grace to take more hold of God. There is little minding of Duty, and that maketh little doing of it: Once ingage your hearts to a love and deſire of more of this, come to a point of reſolution. I muſt know him more, and truſt more in him, be more acquant with him. And Secondly, Put your ſelf in the way of Duty. It is God that only can ſtirr you up, or apply your hearts to the uſing of violence to God: But ye would be found in the outward means much, and in theſe ways God will meet with you, if you wait on him in them.</p>

                  <hi>For thou haſt bid thy face from us]</hi> Here is the greateſt plague, a ſpiritual plague. The laſt <hi>Verſe</hi> was but the beginning of ſorrows, <hi>We all do fade,</hi> &amp;c. But lo, here the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhnent of Miſery, <hi>God hiding his face,</hi> and conſuming them in the hand of their ſins. Firſt, The Lords hiding of his Face, and giving up a people to melt away in their ſins, puniſhing with judicial blindneſs and ſecurity, is the worſt Judgment, it filleth the Cup full. This complaint goeth on ſtill worſe. And certainly, it is worſe, nor their fading as a leaf, and exile out of their Land. It is not without reaſon, that great troubles and afflictions are ſo expreſſed, <hi>thou hid thy face.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>thou hidſt thy face</hi>

                  </gap> It is in ſo far trouble, as it is a ſign of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pleaſure, and as the frowns of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nance are upon it. Therefore, the Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> aggravating their Affliction ſay, <hi>thou hide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> thy face.</hi> You know the face is the plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> wherinto either kindneſs, or unkindneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. The Lords Countenance, or Face is a refreſhful ſweet manifeſtation of himſelf to a Soul; It is the Lord uſing familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with a ſpirit, and this made <hi>David</hi> more glad nor Corn and Wine. Now the hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Face, the withdrawing of his Countenance is, when the Lord in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation and dealing doth withhold the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of himſelf, either in life or conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: When he covereth himſelf with Clouds round about, that neither can a ſoul ſee in to the backſide of it, into his own warm heart, nor can the Sun-beames ſhine thorow, to quicken and refreſh the ſoul. The Lord draweth over his Face, a Vail of a croſſing diſpenſation or ſuch like.</p>
               <p>There is a deſertion of the ſoul in the point of life and ſpiritual action, and there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion in regard of conſolation. The varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Lords deſertions run upon theſe two. As a Chriſtians life is action or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and the Lords influence is either quickening or comforting, ſo his withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is either a prejudice to the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Sometimes <hi>he goeth mourning all the</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:178706:161"/> 
                  <hi>day,</hi> nay, but <hi>he is ſick of love:</hi> Sometime he is a bottle dryed in the ſmoak, and his moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture dried up. The Chriſtians conſolation may be ſubſtracted, and his life abide, but he cannot have ſpiritual conſolation, if he be not lively. This life is more ſubſtantial, comfort is more refreſhful; life is more ſolid, comfort ſweet, that is true growing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his but ſawce to eat it with.</p>
               <p>The hiding here meant is certainly a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual puniſhment. The Lord denying unto this people grace to underſtand the voice of the rod, he appearing as a party againſt them, leaving them to their own carnal and lazie temper, and thus they lay ſtill under Gods diſpleaſure. Now there is nothing like this, firſt, becauſe it is a ſpiritual puniſhment, and eſtates are not to be valued and laid in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with the ſoul. Albeit men are become ſo brutiſh as to abaſe their ſouls, and proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute them to any thing, yet all a man hath, is not conſiderable to it. Secondly, It is a more excellent thing is removed by it, <hi>In his favour is life:</hi> all felicity and happineſs is in Gods countenance. If a man have not this, what hath he elſe? Loſſes are according as the thing is. Nay, but here is more, <hi>My Lord is taken from me, my God hath forgotten me.</hi> And indeed, if mans true happineſs be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, certainly, any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion coming in muſt be ſad, and make a man more miſerable then the world knoweth. There is a greater emphaſis in that word. <hi>Thou haſt bid thy face,</hi> then if he had ſaid, All the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:178706:162"/> world hideth their face and maketh a ſcorn o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> us:</p>
               <p>Therefore firſt, know, what is the worſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thing of the times. Many of you think ſword and peſtilence, and the burdens of the time, the worſt things, and if you were now to complain, the ſaddeſt complaint would be, Affliction is laid on our loins. But know this, if your Cities were deſolate, if your Land were made a wilderneſs, and we cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in another Land, there is yet a worſe thing then all theſe, and think you not this ſtrange? Nay, I ſay, there is ſomething worſe already in us, that we know not of, and it is this, <hi>Make the hearts of this people hard,</hi> A ſpirit of ſlumber and deadneſs from the Lord upon the Land: There are multitudes he will never ſhew his face unto; it is ſtill vailed from them, and they know him not. Ye that think all were well, if ye had peace and proſperity, and know no hiding of Gods countenance, no anger but when he ſtriketh, certainly you know not what his countenance is, by all <hi>theſe things men neither know love nor hatred.</hi> Secondly, Whatever calamity come upon you outwardly, depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat moſt ſpiritual plagues, and Gods deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If you have Gods countenance, it may make you glad in much ſadneſs. You would be moſt careful leſt any partition-wall come in, leſt his countenance change on you, if you grieve his ſpirit and break his heart. Seek to have his face to ſhine, and this ſhall be a Sun <hi>with healing under his wings.</hi> O but Chriſts</p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:178706:170"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it is overclouded with much provocation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Lords hiding of his face hath influence on the temper of ſpirits, and diſpoſition in duties. The truth is in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>In him we live, and move, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

The creatures holineſs, and eſpecially our life, is but as the rayes that the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſendeth forth round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and if any thing come between, it evaniſheth: As the Marigold that openeth it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> leaves when the Sun riſeth, and cloſeth when it goeth down again, ſo exactly doth our ſpiritual conſtitution follow the motions of his countenance, and depend wholly on them, <hi>Thou hides thy face, and they are troubled,</hi> Pſal. 104. 9. The Lord needeth no more but diſcountenance us, and we are gone.</p>
               <p>Alwayes firſt, be more dependent creatures; we uſe to act as from habits within, without any ſubordination to the Lords grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, but we find that our ſufficiency is not of our ſelf. How often doth your ſpiritual condition change on you in an hour? You cannot command one thought of God, or act from any habit of grace even then when you can bring forth other gifts in exerciſe. Ye find that grace findeth more difficulties, moe interruptions, therefore learn to attend the changes and motions of his countenance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When you find your heart dead,
<pb facs="tcp:178706:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:178706:172"/> and you concluded under an impoſſibility of taking hold on God in a lively manner, then I pray you, look unto the Lords ſuſpending of his influence, and let your whole endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours be at the Throne of Grace to help it: It will not be vour own provoking of your ſelf to your duty, but you muſt put your ſelf upon God, that he may cauſe his face to ſhine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though the Lords hiding his face be often a cauſe of our deadneſs, and his deſertion maketh all to wither, yet we have often a culpable hand in it: And he hides his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ce, being provoked ſo to do. One thing we may mention; Grieving of the Holy Ghoſt whereby we are ſealed, quenching the motions of the Spirit, maketh the Spirit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his face with a vail, and hide it. There is here ordinarily a reciprocal or mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. Our grieving him, makes him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his countenance, and his withdrawing his countenance, maketh us to wither and grow barren.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The moſt ſure and infallible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Lords hiding his face, is ſecurity, and a ſpirit of deadneſs and lazineſs; when folk go about duties dreaming, and do all, as it were, thorow their ſleep. Therefore we may conclude ſad things on this Land, that the Lord hideth his face from us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ariſe and do not ſettle and quiet your ſelves in ſuch a condition: The Lord is angry, needeth any more be ſaid? No more needeth to kind children: but the rod muſt follow this to make anger ſenſible.</p>
